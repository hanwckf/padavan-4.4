commit 39b1f6172a2f9ddc74a8f82d6e84dd13b22dbaf2

    Move _obstack_compat out of common
    
    it is impossible to create an alias of a common symbol (as
    compat_symbol does), because common symbols do not have a section or
    an offset until linked.  GNU as tolerates aliases of common symbols by
    simply creating another common symbol, but other assemblers (notably
    LLVM's integrated assembler) are less tolerant.
