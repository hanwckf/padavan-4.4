GNU (which is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix") provides GNU binutils,
GNU C Compiler (gcc), GNU debugger (gdb) and many other utilities. GNU is
considered the master source for these packages.

You should select "GNU" here unless you definitely know that you need some version
from another source.
