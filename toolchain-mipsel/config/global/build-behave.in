config PARALLEL_JOBS
    int
    prompt "Number of parallel jobs"
    default 0
    help
      Number of jobs make will be allowed to run concurently.
      Set this higher than the number of processors you have, but not too high.
      A good rule of thumb is twice the number of processors you have.
      
      Enter 1 to have only one job at a time.

      Enter 0 to set automatically based on how many processors the build
      machine has.

config LOAD
    string
    prompt "Maximum allowed load"
    default ""
    help
      Specifies that no new jobs should be started if there are others jobs
      running and the load average is at least this value.

      Leave to empty for no load limit.

      Note: any float value is allowed and will be passed to the '-l' option
            of make (for further details, refer to the make manpage).

config USE_PIPES
    bool
    prompt "Use -pipe"
    default y
    help
      Use gcc's option -pipe to use pipes rather than temp files when building
      the toolchain.

config EXTRA_CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD
    string
    prompt "Extra build compiler flags"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass to the build C and C++ compiler.

      May be used to change the default features of the build
      compiler such as turning off the stack protector or fortify.
      
config EXTRA_LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD
    string
    prompt "Extra build linker flags"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass to the build linker.

      May be used to change the default features of the build
      linker.
      
config EXTRA_CFLAGS_FOR_HOST
    string
    prompt "Extra host compiler flags"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass to the host C and C++ compiler.

      May be used to change the default features of the host
      compiler such as turning off the stack protector or fortify.
      
config EXTRA_LDFLAGS_FOR_HOST
    string
    prompt "Extra host linker flags"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass to the host linker.

      May be used to change the default features of the host
      linker.

choice
    bool
    prompt "Shell to use as CONFIG_SHELL"
    default CONFIG_SHELL_BASH

config CONFIG_SHELL_SH
    bool
    prompt "sh (the system shell)"
    help
      Use 'sh' as CONFIG_SHELL.
      
      ./configure scripts and Makefiles make intensive use of calling
      sub-shells. This is usually done by calling /bin/sh. /bin/sh ought
      to be an at-least-POSIX-conformant shell (that is, able to interpret
      POSIX shell scripts).
      
      On many (most?) systems, /bin/sh is a symlink to bash. On some other
      systems (eg. Ubuntu, latest Debian), /bin/sh points to dash (or ash).
      bash is a full-featured shell, with many extension to POSIX, but is
      quite slow (see ection BUGS in the bash man page), while dash is
      faster, with very few extensions to POSIX.  On the other hand, some
      ./configure scripts, although written to use /bin/sh, may really
      require to be run by bash.
      
      The default is to use bash, as some components (eg. GMP) will fail
      to build with anything else than bash.
      
      Unless you have a very strong reason not to (eg. you are debugging
      the bashisms in a ./configure script), you should use the default,
      and use bash.

config CONFIG_SHELL_ASH
    bool
    prompt "ash (READ HELP!)"
    help
      Use 'ash' as CONFIG_SHELL.
      
      See help for CONFIG_SHELL_SH, above, for more explanations.
      
      NOTE: It is advised that you do NOT use ash as CONFIG_SHELL, as some
      components are broken. If you decide to use ash, and the build breaks,
      don't come moaning and set the CONFIG_SHELL to bash, below.

config CONFIG_SHELL_BASH
    bool
    prompt "bash"
    help
      Use 'bash' as CONFIG_SHELL.
      
      See help for CONFIG_SHELL_SH, above, for more explanations.

config CONFIG_SHELL_CUSTOM
    bool
    prompt "custom shell"
    help
      Enter full path to the custom shell below.
      
      See help for CONFIG_SHELL_SH, above, for more explanations.
