Support for Alpine Linux as a build or host platform is EXPERIMENTAL. Some of
the packages try to compile binaries for the build or the machine and fail
because they expect certain GLIBC-specific types, etc: Alpine Linux does not
use GNU libc, it uses musl.

Only the following bug reports will be looked into:
- A sample configuration used to build successfully and no longer does. Identify
the commit ID that builds successfully for you.
- A pull request that fixes the build for any sample on the Alpine Linux.

All other bug reports against Alpine as a build/host will be summarily closed.
