These scripts are not of much interest to the end user.
They are used to automate everyday maintenance tasks for crosstool-NG. As such,
they are not subject to the same level of portability requirements - they can
expect to be run on a fairly modern Linux distribution, with bash, GNU sed and
grep, etc.
