 * Shared memory
 *

 * Currently, zero-copy data transfer is supportted, for simple and efficient
 * design.
 *
 * The shared memory lifetime:
 * 1. CA (Client Application at REE) prepares memory
 * 2. CA registers it to TEE scope.
 * 3. A handle is returned. CA can use it to communicate with TEE.
 * 4. If shared memory is not used, CA unregisters it.
 * 5. CA frees memory.
 *
 * Because it is zero-copy shared memory, the memory characteritics is
 * inherited. If the shared memory will be used for HW, CA must allocate
 * physical continuous memory.
 *
 * Note: Because shared memory can be seen by both Normal and Secure world.
 * It is a possible weakpoint to bed attacked or leak secure data.
 *
 * Note: ONLY support memory allocated by kmalloc!!!
