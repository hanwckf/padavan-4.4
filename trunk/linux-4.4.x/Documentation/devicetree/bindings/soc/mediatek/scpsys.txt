MediaTek SCPSYS
===============

The System Control Processor System (SCPSYS) has several power management
related tasks in the system. The tasks include thermal measurement, dynamic
voltage frequency scaling (DVFS), interrupt filter and lowlevel sleep control.
The System Power Manager (SPM) inside the SCPSYS is for the MTCMOS power
domain control.

The driver implements the Generic PM domain bindings described in
power/power_domain.txt. It provides the power domains defined in
include/dt-bindings/power/mt8173-power.h and mt2701-power.h.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of:
	- "mediatek,mt2701-scpsys"
	- "mediatek,mt8173-scpsys"
- #power-domain-cells: Must be 1
- reg: Address range of the SCPSYS unit
- infracfg: must contain a phandle to the infracfg controller
- clock, clock-names: clocks according to the common clock binding.
                      These are clocks which hardware needs to be
                      enabled before enabling certain power domains.
	Required clocks for MT2701: "mm", "mfg", "ethif"
	Required clocks for MT8173: "mm", "mfg", "venc", "venc_lt"

Example:

	scpsys: scpsys@10006000 {
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-scpsys";
		reg = <0 0x10006000 0 0x1000>;
		infracfg = <&infracfg>;
		clocks = <&clk26m>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_MM_SEL>;
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_VENC_SEL>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_VENC_LT_SEL>;
		clock-names = "mfg", "mm", "venc", "venc_lt";
	};

Example consumer:

	afe: mt8173-afe-pcm@11220000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-afe-pcm";
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT8173_POWER_DOMAIN_AUDIO>;
	};
