Texas Instruments TAS5711/TAS5717/TAS5719 stereo power amplifiers

The codec is controlled through an I2C interface.  It also has two other
signals that can be wired up to GPIOs: reset (strongly recommended), and
powerdown (optional).

Required properties:

- compatible: "ti,tas5711", "ti,tas5717", or "ti,tas5719"
- reg: The I2C address of the device
- #sound-dai-cells: must be equal to 0

Optional properties:

- reset-gpios: GPIO specifier for the TAS571x's active low reset line
- pdn-gpios: GPIO specifier for the TAS571x's active low powerdown line
- clocks: clock phandle for the MCLK input
- clock-names: should be "mclk"
- AVDD-supply: regulator phandle for the AVDD supply (all chips)
- DVDD-supply: regulator phandle for the DVDD supply (all chips)
- HPVDD-supply: regulator phandle for the HPVDD supply (5717/5719)
- PVDD_AB-supply: regulator phandle for the PVDD_AB supply (5717/5719)
- PVDD_CD-supply: regulator phandle for the PVDD_CD supply (5717/5719)
- PVDD_A-supply: regulator phandle for the PVDD_A supply (5711)
- PVDD_B-supply: regulator phandle for the PVDD_B supply (5711)
- PVDD_C-supply: regulator phandle for the PVDD_C supply (5711)
- PVDD_D-supply: regulator phandle for the PVDD_D supply (5711)

Example:

	tas5717: audio-codec@2a {
		compatible = "ti,tas5717";
		reg = <0x2a>;
		#sound-dai-cells = <0>;

		reset-gpios = <&gpio5 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		pdn-gpios = <&gpio5 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		clocks = <&clk_core CLK_I2S>;
		clock-names = "mclk";
	};
