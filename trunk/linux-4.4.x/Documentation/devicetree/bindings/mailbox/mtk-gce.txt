MediaTek GCE
===============

The Global Command Engine (GCE) is used to help read/write registers with
critical time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
vblank. The GCE can be used to implement the Command Queue (CMDQ) driver.

CMDQ driver uses mailbox framework for communication. Please refer to
mailbox.txt for generic information about mailbox device-tree bindings.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8173-gce"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock
- #mbox-cells: Should be 2

Required properties for a client device:
- mboxes: client use mailbox to communicate with GCE, it should have this
  property and list of phandle, mailbox channel specifiers, and atomic
  execution flag.

Example:

	gce: gce@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-gce";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_GCE>;
		clock-names = "gce";

		#mbox-cells = <2>;
	};

Example for a client device:

	mmsys: clock-controller@14000000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-mmsys";
		mboxes = <&gce 0 1 /* main display with atomic execution */
			  &gce 1 1>; /* sub display with atomic execution */
		...
	};
