Ramoops oops/panic logger
=========================

ramoops provides persistent RAM storage for oops and panics, so they can be
recovered after a reboot.

Parts of this storage may be set aside for other persistent log buffers, such
as kernel log messages, or for optional ECC error-correction data.  The total
size of these optional buffers must fit in the reserved region.

Any remaining space will be used for a circular buffer of oops and panic
records.  These records have a configurable size, with a size of 0 indicating
that they should be disabled.


Required properties:

- compatible: must be "ramoops"

- memory-region: phandle to a region of memory that is preserved between reboots


Optional properties:

- ecc-size: enables ECC support and specifies ECC buffer size in bytes
  (defaults to no ECC)

- record-size: maximum size in bytes of each dump done on oops/panic
  (defaults to 0)

- console-size: size in bytes of log buffer reserved for kernel messages
  (defaults to 0)

- ftrace-size: size in bytes of log buffer reserved for function tracing and
  profiling (defaults to 0)

- pmsg-size: size in bytes of log buffer reserved for userspace messages
  (defaults to 0)

- unbuffered: if present, use unbuffered mappings to map the reserved region
  (defaults to buffered mappings)

- no-dump-oops: if present, only dump panics (defaults to panics and oops)
