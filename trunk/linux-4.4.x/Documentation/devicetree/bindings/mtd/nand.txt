* MTD generic binding

- nand-ecc-mode : String, operation mode of the NAND ecc mode.
  Supported values are: "none", "soft", "hw", "hw_syndrome", "hw_oob_first",
  "soft_bch".
- nand-bus-width : 8 or 16 bus width if not present 8
- nand-on-flash-bbt: boolean to enable on flash bbt option if not present false

- nand-ecc-strength: integer representing the number of bits to correct
		     per ECC step.

- nand-ecc-step-size: integer representing the number of data bytes
		      that are covered by a single ECC step.

- linux,part-probe: list of name as strings of the partition parser
		    which should be used to parse the partition table.
		    They will be tried in the specified ordering and
		    the next one will be used if the previous one
		    failed.

		    Example: linux,part-probe = "cmdlinepart", "ofpart";

		    This is also the default value, which will be used
		    if this attribute is not specified. It could be
		    that the flash driver in use overwrote the default
		    value and uses some other default.

		    Possible values are: bcm47xxpart, afs, ar7part,
		    ofoldpart, ofpart, bcm63xxpart, RedBoot, cmdlinepart

The ECC strength and ECC step size properties define the correction capability
of a controller. Together, they say a controller can correct "{strength} bit
errors per {size} bytes".

The interpretation of these parameters is implementation-defined, so not all
implementations must support all possible combinations. However, implementations
are encouraged to further specify the value(s) they support.
