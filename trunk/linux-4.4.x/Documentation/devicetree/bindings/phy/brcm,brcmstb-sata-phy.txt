* Broadcom SATA3 PHY for STB

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one or more of
     "brcm,bcm7445-sata-phy"
     "brcm,phy-sata3"
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0
- reg: register range for the PHY PCB interface
- reg-names: should be "phy"

Sub-nodes:
  Each port's PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the PHY number
- phy-cells: generic PHY binding; must be 0
Optional:
- brcm,enable-ssc: use spread spectrum clocking (SSC) on this port


Example:

	sata-phy@f0458100 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7445-sata-phy", "brcm,phy-sata3";
		reg = <0xf0458100 0x1e00>, <0xf045804c 0x10>;
		reg-names = "phy";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		sata-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};

		sata-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
