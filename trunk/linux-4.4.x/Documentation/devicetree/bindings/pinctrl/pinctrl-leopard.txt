== MediaTek leopard pinctrl controller ==

Required properties for the root node:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	       "mediatek,leopard-pinctrl" for leopard SoC
 - reg: offset and length of the pinctrl space

 - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
 - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
   second is the GPIO flags.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

leopard pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for a
pin, a group, or a list of pins or groups. This configuration can include the
mux function to select on those pin(s)/group(s), and various pin configuration
parameters, such as pull-up, slew rate, etc.

We support 2 types of configuration nodes. Those nodes can be either pinmux
nodes or pinconf nodes. Each configuration node can consist of multiple nodes
describing the pinmux and pinconf options.

The name of each subnode doesn't matter as long as it is unique; all subnodes
should be enumerated and processed purely based on their content.

== pinmux nodes content ==

The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
to specify in a pinmux subnode:

Required properties are:
 - groups: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a group.
  Valid values for these names are listed below.
 - function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
  group. Valid values for function names are listed below.

== pinconf nodes content ==

The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
to specify in a pinconf subnode:

Required properties are:
 - pins: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a pin.
  Valid values for these names are listed below.
 - groups: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a group.
  Valid values for these names are listed below.

Optional properies are:
 bias-disable, bias-pull, bias-pull-down, input-enable,
 input-schmitt-enable, input-schmitt-disable, output-enable
 output-low, output-high, drive-strength, slew-rate

 Valid arguments for 'slew-rate' are '0' for no slew rate controlled and '1' for
 slower slew rate respectively.
 Valid arguments for 'drive-strength', 4, 8, 12, or 16 in mA.

The following specific properties as defined are valid to specify in a pinconf
subnode:

Optional properties are:
 - mediatek,tdsel: An integer describing the steps for output level shifter duty
   cycle when asserted (high pulse width adjustment). Valid arguments are from 0
   to 15.
 - mediatek,rdsel: An integer describing the steps for input level shifter duty
   cycle when asserted (high pulse width adjustment). Valid arguments are from 0
   to 63.

== Valid values for pins, function and groups on leopard ==

Valid values for pins are:
pins can be referenced via the pin names as the below table shown and the
related physical number is also put ahead of those names which helps cross
references to pins between groups to know whether pins assignment conflict
happens among devices try to acquire those available pins.
