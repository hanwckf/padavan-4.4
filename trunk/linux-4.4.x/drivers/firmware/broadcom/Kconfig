	help
	  Broadcom home routers contain flash partition called "nvram" with all
	  important hardware configuration as well as some minor user setup.
	  NVRAM partition contains a text-like data representing name=value
	  pairs.
	  This driver provides an easy way to get value of requested parameter.
	  It simply reads content of NVRAM and parses it. It doesn't control any
	  hardware part itself.
