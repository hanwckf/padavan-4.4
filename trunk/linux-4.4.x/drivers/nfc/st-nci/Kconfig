config NFC_ST_NCI
	tristate "STMicroelectronics ST NCI NFC driver"
	depends on NFC_NCI
	default n
	---help---
	  STMicroelectronics NFC NCI chips core driver. It implements the chipset
	  NCI logic and hooks into the NFC kernel APIs. Physical layers will
	  register against it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called st-nci.
	  Say N if unsure.

config NFC_ST_NCI_I2C
	tristate "NFC ST NCI i2c support"
	depends on NFC_ST_NCI && I2C
	---help---
	  This module adds support for an I2C interface to the
	  STMicroelectronics NFC NCI chips familly.
	  Select this if your platform is using the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called st-nci_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.

config NFC_ST_NCI_SPI
	tristate "NFC ST NCI spi support"
	depends on NFC_ST_NCI && SPI
	---help---
	  This module adds support for an SPI interface to the
	  STMicroelectronics NFC NCI chips familly.
	  Select this if your platform is using the spi bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called st-nci_spi.
	  Say N if unsure.
