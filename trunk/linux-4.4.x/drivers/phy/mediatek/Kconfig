      Say 'Y' here to add support for MediaTek T-PHY driver,
      it supports multiple usb2.0, usb3.0 ports, PCIe and
	  SATA, and meanwhile supports two version T-PHY which have
	  different banks layout, the T-PHY with shared banks between
	  multi-ports is first version, otherwise is second veriosn,
	  so you can easily distinguish them by banks layout.
