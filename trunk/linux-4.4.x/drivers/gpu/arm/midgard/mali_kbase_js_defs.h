 * - In the case of the runpool, it is a cache of "Do any contexts owned by
 * the runpool have attribute X?"
 * - In the case of a context, it is a cache of "Do any atoms owned by the
 * context have attribute X?"
 *
 * The boolean value of the context attributes often affect scheduling
 * decisions, such as affinities to use and job slots to use.
 *
 * To accomodate changes of state in the context, each attribute is refcounted
 * in the context, and in the runpool for all running contexts. Specifically:
 * - The runpool holds a refcount of how many contexts in the runpool have this
 * attribute.
 * - The context holds a refcount of how many atoms have this attribute.
