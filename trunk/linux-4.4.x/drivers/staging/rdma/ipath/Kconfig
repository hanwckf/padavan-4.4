	---help---
	This is a driver for the deprecated QLogic Hyper-Transport
	IB host channel adapter (model QHT7140),
	including InfiniBand verbs support.  This driver allows these
	devices to be used with both kernel upper level protocols such
	as IP-over-InfiniBand as well as with userspace applications
	(in conjunction with InfiniBand userspace access).
	For QLogic PCIe QLE based cards, use the QIB driver instead.

	If you have this hardware you will need to boot with PAT disabled
	on your x86-64 systems, use the nopat kernel parameter.

	Note that this driver will soon be removed entirely from the kernel.
