To build one of the programs, just go to its subdirectory and run
make. There's no configure script, since the programs by their nature
are written for x86 Linux.

(Some of the programs are architecture and Unix-flavor-neutral, and so
could be used on other configurations. However I have not had the
opportunity to test my code on anything but x86 Linux, so I can make
no guarantees.)

A top-level makefile is also provided. All it does is recursively
invoke the makefile in each subdirectory, and then copy the programs
and man pages to their own directories (bin and doc, respectively).
You can feel free to ignore it. The top-level makefile also provides a
default installation step. By default the root destination for the
install is /usr/local; set the makefile variables "prefix" to a
different value to change this. (Alternately, as each program is
self-contained, you can just use cp(1) to manually install the
programs and/or man pages to the destination of your choice.)
