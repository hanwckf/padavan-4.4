README for uC-libc on the m68k[nommu] architecture

James Graves <jgraves@deltamobile.com>

For now (2001/1/9) support for the m68k should be considered "alpha"
quality at best.  It mostly works OK for some of the stuff I'm working
on, but you can't fully compile other things (like the user
applications for uClinux).  Needs lots more testing.

Only developed/tested with m68k-pic-coff-gcc 2.7.2.3-pic-060999, from
Lineo.

Configuration:

	Read and edit the Config file, carefully.

	TARGET_ARCH=m68k
	CROSS_COMPILE = m68k-pic-coff-
	CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
	STRIPTOOL = $(CROSS_COMPILE)strip
	KERNEL_SOURCE=/opt/uClinux/linux
	HAS_MMU = false
	HAS_FLOATS = false
	MALLOC = malloc-simple
	INSTALL_DIR = /opt/uClinux/m68k-pic-coff

	The regular malloc library is broken, dunno why.  Use
	simple-malloc.

Installation:
	Theoretically, you should be able to install right over the
	existing uC-libc 0.9.1 files in
	/opt/uClinux/m68k-pic-coff/include, but I recommend cleaning
	out all the include files there.

	The only file in there that's not from the old uC-libc is
	assert.h, but I don't know why that would be the valid copy.

	run:
		make install

Problems:

	I _may_ be able to help if you run into problems.  Create a
	really, really short program that demonstrates the problem,
	and contact me.

TODO:
	Fix vfork().

	Does crt0.o still need to be a separate file?  Can't I just
	stick it in libc.a and be done with it?  Is that specified in
	the GCC link options?
