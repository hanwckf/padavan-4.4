/* The format of struct sigcontext changed between 2.0 and 2.1 kernels.
   Fortunately 2.0 puts a magic number in the first word and this is not
   a legal value for `trap_no', so we can tell them apart.  */

/* Early 2.2 and 2.3 kernels do not have the `fault_address' member in
   the sigcontext structure.  Unfortunately there is no reliable way
   to test for its presence and this word will contain garbage for too-old
   kernels.  Versions 2.2.14 and 2.3.35 (plus later versions) are known to
   include this element.  */
