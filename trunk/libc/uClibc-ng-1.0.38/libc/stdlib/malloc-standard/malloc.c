/*
  Debugging support

  Because freed chunks may be overwritten with bookkeeping fields, this
  malloc will often die when freed memory is overwritten by user
  programs.  This can be very effective (albeit in an annoying way)
  in helping track down dangling pointers.

  If you compile with __UCLIBC_MALLOC_DEBUGGING__, a number of assertion checks are
  enabled that will catch more memory errors. You probably won't be
  able to make much sense of the actual assertion errors, but they
  should help you locate incorrectly overwritten memory.  The
  checking is fairly extensive, and will slow down execution
  noticeably. Calling malloc_stats or mallinfo with __UCLIBC_MALLOC_DEBUGGING__ set will
  attempt to check every non-mmapped allocated and free chunk in the
  course of computing the summmaries. (By nature, mmapped regions
  cannot be checked very much automatically.)

  Setting __UCLIBC_MALLOC_DEBUGGING__ may also be helpful if you are trying to modify
  this code. The assertions in the check routines spell out in more
  detail the assumptions and invariants underlying the algorithms.

  Setting __UCLIBC_MALLOC_DEBUGGING__ does NOT provide an automated mechanism for checking
  that all accesses to malloced memory stay within their
  bounds. However, there are several add-ons and adaptations of this
  or other mallocs available that do this.
