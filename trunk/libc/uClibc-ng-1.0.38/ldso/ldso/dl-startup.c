/*
 * The main trick with this program is that initially, we ourselves are not
 * dynamically linked.  This means that we cannot access any global variables
 * or call any functions.  No globals initially, since the Global Offset Table
 * (GOT) is initialized by the linker assuming a virtual address of 0, and no
 * function calls initially since the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) is not yet
 * initialized.
 *
 * There are additional initial restrictions - we cannot use large switch
 * statements, since the compiler generates tables of addresses and jumps
 * through them.  We cannot use normal syscall stubs, because these all
 * reference the errno global variable which is not yet initialized.  We _can_
 * use all of the local stack variables that we want.  We _can_ use inline
 * functions, because these do not transfer control to a new address, but they
 * must be static so that they are not exported from the modules.
 *
 * Life is further complicated by the fact that initially we do not want to do
 * a complete dynamic linking.  We want to allow the user to supply new
 * functions to override symbols (i.e. weak symbols and/or LD_PRELOAD).  So
 * initially, we only perform relocations for variables that start with "_dl_"
 * since ANSI specifies that the user is not supposed to redefine any of these
 * variables.
 *
 * Fortunately, the linker itself leaves a few clues lying around, and when the
 * kernel starts the image, there are a few further clues.  First of all, there
 * is Auxiliary Vector Table information sitting on the stack which is provided
 * to us by the kernel, and which includes information about the address
 * that the program interpreter was loaded at, the number of sections, the
 * address the application was loaded at, and so forth.  Here this information
 * is stored in the array auxvt.  For details see linux/fs/binfmt_elf.c where
 * it calls NEW_AUX_ENT() a bunch of times....
 *
 * Next, we need to find the GOT.  On most arches there is a register pointing
 * to the GOT, but just in case (and for new ports) I've added some (slow) C
 * code to locate the GOT for you.
 *
 * This code was originally written for SVr4, and there the kernel would load
 * all text pages R/O, so they needed to call mprotect a zillion times to mark
 * all text pages as writable so dynamic linking would succeed.  Then when they
 * were done, they would change the protections for all the pages back again.
 * Well, under Linux everything is loaded writable (since Linux does copy on
 * write anyways) so all the mprotect stuff has been disabled.
 *
 * Initially, we do not have access to _dl_malloc since we can't yet make
 * function calls, so we mmap one page to use as scratch space.  Later on, when
 * we can call _dl_malloc we reuse this this memory.  This is also beneficial,
 * since we do not want to use the same memory pool as malloc anyway - esp if
 * the user redefines malloc to do something funky.
 *
 * Our first task is to perform a minimal linking so that we can call other
 * portions of the dynamic linker.  Once we have done this, we then build the
 * list of modules that the application requires, using LD_LIBRARY_PATH if this
 * is not a suid program (/usr/lib otherwise).  Once this is done, we can do
 * the dynamic linking as required, and we must omit the things we did to get
 * the dynamic linker up and running in the first place.  After we have done
 * this, we just have a few housekeeping chores and we can transfer control to
 * the user's application.
