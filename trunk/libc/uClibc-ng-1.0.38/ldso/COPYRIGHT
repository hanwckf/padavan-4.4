/* Notice of general intent:
 *
 * The linux operating system generally contains large amounts of code
 * that fall under the GNU General Public License, or GPL for short.
 * This file contains source code that by it's very nature would always
 * be linked with an application program, and because of this a GPL
 * type of copyright on this file would place restrictions upon the
 * distribution of binary-only commercial software.  Since the goal of
 * the Linux project as a whole is not to discourage the development and
 * distribution of commercial software for Linux, this file has been
 * placed under a more relaxed BSD-style of copyright.
 *
 * It is the general understanding of the above contributors that a
 * program executable linked to a library containing code that falls
 * under the GPL or GLPL style of license is not subject to the terms of
 * the GPL or GLPL license if the program executable(s) that are supplied
 * are linked to a shared library form of the GPL or GLPL library, and as
 * long as the form of the shared library is such that it is possible for
 * the end user to modify and rebuild the library and use it in
 * conjunction with the program executable.
