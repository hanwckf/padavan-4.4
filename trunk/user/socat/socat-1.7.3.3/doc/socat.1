.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
\fBSocat\fP is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte
streams and transfers data between them\&. Because the streams can be constructed
from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources 
(see address types), and because lots of
address options may be applied to the streams, socat can
be used for many different purposes\&. 
.PP 
\fBFilan\fP is a utility that prints information about its active file
descriptors to stdout\&. It has been written for debugging \fBsocat\fP, but might be
useful for other purposes too\&. Use the \-h option to find more infos\&.
.PP 
\fBProcan\fP is a utility that prints information about process parameters to
stdout\&. It has been written to better understand 
some UNIX process properties and for debugging \fBsocat\fP, but might be 
useful for other purposes too\&.
.PP 
The life cycle of a \fBsocat\fP instance typically consists of four phases\&.
.PP 
In the \fIinit\fP phase, the command line options are parsed and logging is
initialized\&. 
.PP 
During the \fIopen\fP phase, \fBsocat\fP opens the first address and afterwards the
second address\&. These steps are usually blocking; thus, especially for complex address types like socks,
connection requests or authentication dialogs must be completed before the next
step is started\&.
.PP 
In the \fItransfer\fP phase, \fBsocat\fP watches both streams\(cq\& read and write file
descriptors via 
\f(CWselect()\fP
, and, when data is available on one side \fIand\fP
can be written to the other side, socat reads it, performs newline
character conversions if required, and writes the data to the write file
descriptor of the other stream, then continues waiting for more data in both
directions\&.
.PP 
When one of the streams effectively reaches EOF, the \fIclosing\fP phase
begins\&. \fBSocat\fP transfers the EOF condition to the other stream,
i\&.e\&. tries to shutdown only its write stream, giving it a chance to
terminate gracefully\&. For a defined time \fBsocat\fP continues to transfer data in
the other direction, but then closes all remaining channels and terminates\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP 
\fBSocat\fP provides some command line options that modify the behaviour of the
program\&. They have nothing to do with so called
address options that are used as parts of address specifications\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-V\fP\fP"
Print version and available feature information to stdout, and exit\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-h | \-?\fP\fP"
Print a help text to stdout describing command line options and available address
types, and exit\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-hh | \-??\fP\fP"
Like \-h, plus a list of the short names of all available address options\&. Some options are
platform dependend, so this output is helpful for checking the particular
implementation\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-hhh | \-???\fP\fP"
Like \-hh, plus a list of all available address option names\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-d\fP\fP"
Without this option, only fatal and error messages are generated; applying
this option also prints warning messages\&. See DIAGNOSTICS
for more information\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-d \-d\fP\fP"
Prints fatal, error, warning, and notice messages\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-d \-d \-d\fP\fP"
Prints fatal, error, warning, notice, and info messages\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-d \-d \-d \-d\fP\fP"
Prints fatal, error, warning, notice, info, and debug
messages\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-D\fP\fP"
Logs information about file descriptors before starting the transfer phase\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-ly[<facility>]\fP\fP"
Writes messages to syslog instead of stderr; severity as defined with \-d
option\&. With optional <facility>, the syslog type can
be selected, default is \(dq\&daemon\(dq\&\&. Third party libraries might not obey this
option\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-lf\fP\fP\f(CW <logfile>\fP"
Writes messages to <logfile> [filename] instead of
stderr\&. Some third party libraries, in particular libwrap, might not obey
this option\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-ls\fP\fP"
Writes messages to stderr (this is the default)\&. Some third party libraries 
might not obey this option, in particular libwrap appears to only log to
syslog\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-lp\fP\fP\f(CW<progname>\fP"
Overrides the program name printed in error messages and used for
constructing environment variable names\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-lu\fP\fP"
Extends the timestamp of error messages to microsecond resolution\&. Does not
work when logging to syslog\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-lm[<facility>]\fP\fP"
Mixed log mode\&. During startup messages are printed to stderr; when \fBsocat\fP 
starts the transfer phase loop or daemon mode (i\&.e\&. after opening all
streams and before starting data transfer, or, with listening sockets with
fork option, before the first accept call), it switches logging to syslog\&. 
With optional <facility>, the syslog type can be
selected, default is \(dq\&daemon\(dq\&\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-lh\fP\fP"
Adds hostname to log messages\&. Uses the value from environment variable
HOSTNAME or the value retrieved with \f(CWuname()\fP if HOSTNAME is not set\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-v\fP\fP"
Writes the transferred data not only to their target streams, but also to
stderr\&. The output format is text with some conversions for readability, and
prefixed with \(dq\&> \(dq\& or \(dq\&< \(dq\& indicating flow directions\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-x\fP\fP"
Writes the transferred data not only to their target streams, but also to
stderr\&. The output format is hexadecimal, prefixed with \(dq\&> \(dq\& or \(dq\&< \(dq\&
indicating flow directions\&. Can be combined with 
\f(CW\-v\fP
\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-b\fP\fP\f(CW<size>\fP"
Sets the data transfer block <size> [size_t]\&.
At most <size> bytes are transferred per step\&. Default is 8192 bytes\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-s\fP\fP"
By default, \fBsocat\fP terminates when an error occurred to prevent the process
from running when some option could not be applied\&. With this
option, \fBsocat\fP is sloppy with errors and tries to continue\&. Even with this
option, socat will exit on fatals, and will abort connection attempts when
security checks failed\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-t\fP\fP\f(CW<timeout>\fP"
When one channel has reached EOF, the write part of the other channel is shut
down\&. Then, \fBsocat\fP waits <timeout> [timeval] seconds
before terminating\&. Default is 0\&.5 seconds\&. This timeout only applies to
addresses where write and read part can be closed independently\&. When during
the timeout interval the read part gives EOF, socat terminates without
awaiting the timeout\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-T\fP\fP\f(CW<timeout>\fP"
Total inactivity timeout: when socat is already in the transfer loop and
nothing has happened for <timeout> [timeval] seconds
(no data arrived, no interrupt occurred\&.\&.\&.) then it terminates\&.
Useful with protocols like UDP that cannot transfer EOF\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-u\fP\fP"
Uses unidirectional mode\&. The first address is only used for reading, and the
second address is only used for writing (example)\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-U\fP\fP"
Uses unidirectional mode in reverse direction\&. The first address is only
used for writing, and the second address is only used for reading\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-g\fP\fP"
During address option parsing, don\(cq\&t check if the option is considered
useful in the given address environment\&. Use it if you want to force, e\&.g\&.,
appliance of a socket option to a serial device\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-L\fP\fP\f(CW<lockfile>\fP"
If lockfile exists, exits with error\&. If lockfile does not exist, creates it
and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-W\fP\fP\f(CW<lockfile>\fP"
If lockfile exists, waits until it disappears\&. When lockfile does not exist,
creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-4\fP\fP"
Use IP version 4 in case that the addresses do not implicitly or explicitly
specify a version; this is the default\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CW\-6\fP\fP"
Use IP version 6 in case that the addresses do not implicitly or explicitly
specify a version\&.

.PP 
.SH "ADDRESS SPECIFICATIONS"

.PP 
With the address command line arguments, the user gives \fBsocat\fP instructions and
the necessary information for establishing the byte streams\&. 
.PP 
An address specification usually consists of an address type
keyword, zero or more required address parameters separated by \(cq\&:\(cq\& from the keyword and
from each 
other, and zero or more address options separated by \(cq\&,\(cq\&\&. 
.PP 
The keyword specifies the address type (e\&.g\&., TCP4, OPEN, EXEC)\&. For some
keywords there exist synonyms (\(cq\&\-\(cq\& for STDIO, TCP for TCP4)\&. Keywords are case
insensitive\&.
For a few special address types, the keyword may be omitted:
Address specifications starting with a number are assumed to be FD (raw file
descriptor) addresses; 
if a \(cq\&/\(cq\& is found before the first \(cq\&:\(cq\& or \(cq\&,\(cq\&, GOPEN (generic file open) is
assumed\&. 
.PP 
The required number and type of address parameters depend on the address
type\&. E\&.g\&., TCP4 requires a server specification (name or address), and a port
specification (number or service name)\&. 
.PP 
Zero or more address options may be given with each address\&. They influence the
address in some ways\&. 
Options consist of an option keyword or an option keyword and a value,
separated by \(cq\&=\(cq\&\&. Option keywords are case insensitive\&.
For filtering the options that are useful with an address
type, each option is member of one option group\&. For
each address type there is a set of option groups allowed\&. Only options
belonging to one of these address groups may be used (except with option \-g)\&. 
.PP 
Address specifications following the above schema are also called \fIsingle\fP
address specifications\&.
Two single addresses can be combined with \(dq\&!!\(dq\& to form a \fIdual\fP type
address for one channel\&. Here, the first address is used by \fBsocat\fP for reading
data, and the 
second address for writing data\&. There is no way to specify an option only once
for being applied to both single addresses\&.
.PP 
Usually, addresses are opened in read/write
mode\&. When an address is part of a dual address specification, or when
option \-u or \-U is used, an address might be
used only for reading or for writing\&. Considering this is important with some
address types\&.
.PP 
With socat version 1\&.5\&.0 and higher, the lexical analysis tries to handle
quotes and parenthesis meaningfully and allows escaping of special characters\&. 
If one of the characters ( { [ \(cq\& is found, the corresponding closing 
character \- ) } ] \(cq\& \- is looked for; they may also be nested\&. Within these
constructs, socats special characters and strings : , !! are not handled
specially\&. All those characters and strings can be escaped with \e or within \(dq\&\(dq\&
.PP 
.SH "ADDRESS TYPES"

.PP 
This section describes the available address types with their keywords,
parameters, and semantics\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWCREATE:<filename>\fP\fP"
Opens <filename> with 
\f(CWcreat()\fP
and uses the file
descriptor for writing\&. 
This address type requires write\-only context, because a file opened with
\f(CWcreat\fP
cannot be read from\&. 
.br 
Flags like O_LARGEFILE cannot be applied\&. If you need them use
OPEN with options
create,create\&. 
.br 
<filename> must be a valid existing or not existing path\&.
If <filename> is a named pipe, 
\f(CWcreat()\fP
might block;
if <filename> refers to a socket, this is an error\&.
.br 
Option groups: FD,REG,NAMED 
.br 
Useful options:
mode,
user,
group,
unlink\-early,
unlink\-late,
append
.br

.IP "\fB\f(CWEXEC:<command\-line>\fP\fP"
Forks a sub process that establishes communication with its parent process
and invokes the specified program with 
\f(CWexecvp()\fP
\&.
<command\-line> is a simple command
with arguments separated by single spaces\&. If the program name
contains a \(cq\&/\(cq\&, the part after the last \(cq\&/\(cq\& is taken as ARGV[0]\&. If the
program name is a relative 
path, the 
\f(CWexecvp()\fP
semantics for finding the program via
\f(CW$PATH\fP
apply\&. After successful program start, \fBsocat\fP writes data to stdin of the
process and reads from its stdout using a UNIX domain socket generated by
\f(CWsocketpair()\fP
per default\&. (example) 
.br 
Option groups: FD,SOCKET,EXEC,FORK,TERMIOS

.IP "\fB\f(CWGOPEN:<filename>\fP\fP"
(Generic open) This address type tries to handle any file system entry
except directories usefully\&. <filename> may be a
relative or absolute path\&. If it already exists, its type is checked\&. 
In case of a UNIX domain socket, \fBsocat\fP connects; if connecting fails,
\fBsocat\fP assumes a datagram socket and uses 
\f(CWsendto()\fP
calls\&.
If the entry is not a socket, \fBsocat\fP opens it applying the 
\f(CWO_APPEND\fP
flag\&. 
If it does not exist, it is opened with flag
\f(CWO_CREAT\fP
as a regular file (example)\&.

.IP "\fB\f(CWIP\-SENDTO:<host>:<protocol>\fP\fP"
Opens a raw IP socket\&. Depending on host specification or option pf, IP protocol version
4 or 6 is used\&. It uses <protocol> to send packets
to <host> [IP address] and receives packets from
host, ignores packets from other hosts\&. 
Protocol 255 uses the raw socket with the IP header being part of the
data\&.

.IP "\fB\f(CWIP\-DATAGRAM:<address>:<protocol>\fP\fP"
Sends outgoing data to the specified address which may in particular be a
broadcast or multicast address\&. Packets arriving on the local socket are
checked if their source addresses match
RANGE or TCPWRAP
options\&. This address type can for example be used for implementing
symmetric or asymmetric broadcast or multicast communications\&.

note that IPv6 does not know broadcasts\&.
.br 
Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP6,RANGE 
.br 

.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWIP\-RECVFROM:<protocol>\fP\fP"
Opens a raw IP socket of <protocol>\&. Depending on option pf, IP protocol version
4 or 6 is used\&. It receives one packet from an unspecified peer and may send one or more answer packets to that peer\&.
This mode is particularly useful with fork option where each arriving packet \- from arbitrary peers \- is handled by its own sub process\&.
This allows a behaviour similar to typical UDP based servers like ntpd or
named\&.
.br 
Please note that the reply packets might be fetched as incoming traffic when
sender and receiver IP address are identical because there is no port number
to distinguish the sockets\&.
.br 
This address works well with IP\-SENDTO address peers (see above)\&.
Protocol 255 uses the raw socket with the IP header being part of the
data\&.

.br 
NOTE: Up to version 1\&.7\&.2\&.4
the server certificate was only checked for validity against the system
certificate store or cafile or

.PP 
.SH "ADDRESS OPTIONS"

.PP 
Address options can be applied to address specifications to influence the
process of opening the addresses and the 
properties of the resulting data channels\&. 
.PP 
For technical reasons not every option can be
applied to every address type; e\&.g\&., applying a socket option to a regular file
will fail\&. To catch most useless combinations as early as in the open phase,
the concept of \fIoption groups\fP was introduced\&. Each option belongs to one
or more option groups\&. Options can be used only with address types that support
at least one of their option groups (but see option \-g)\&.
.PP 
Address options have data types that their values must conform to\&. 
Every address option consists of just a keyword or a keyword followed by
\(dq\&=value\(dq\&, where value must conform to the options type\&.
Some address options manipulate parameters of system calls;
e\&.g\&., option sync sets the 
\f(CWO_SYNC\fP
flag with the 
\f(CWopen()\fP
call\&. 
Other options cause a system or library call; e\&.g\&., with option `ttl=value\(cq\&
the 
\f(CWsetsockopt(fd, SOL_IP, IP_TTL, value, sizeof(int))\fP
call is applied\&.
Other
options set internal \fBsocat\fP variables that are used during data transfer;
e\&.g\&., `crnl\(cq\& causes explicit character conversions\&. 
A few options have more complex implementations; e\&.g\&., su\-d
(substuser\-delayed) inquires some user and group infos, stores them, and
applies them later after a possible 
\f(CWchroot()\fP
call\&.
.PP 
If multiple options are given to an address, their sequence in the address specification has (almost) no
effect on the sequence of their execution/application\&. Instead, \fBsocat\fP has
built in an \fIoption phase\fP model that tries to bring the options in a useful
order\&. Some options exist in different forms (e\&.g\&., 
unlink, unlink\-early, unlink\-late) to control the time of their execution\&.
.PP 
If the same option is specified more than once within one address
specification, with equal or different values, the effect depends on the kind of option\&. Options
resulting in function calls like 
\f(CWsetsockopt()\fP
cause multiple
invocations\&. With options that set parameters for a required call like
\f(CWopen()\fP
or set internal flags, the value of the last option occurrence is effective\&.
.PP 
The existence or semantics of many options are system dependent\&. \fBSocat\fP
usually does NOT try to emulate missing libc or kernel features, it just
provides an 
interface to the underlying system\&. So, if an operating system lacks a feature,
the related option is simply not available on this platform\&.
.PP 
The following paragraphs introduce just the more common address options\&. For
a more comprehensive reference and to find information about canonical option
names, alias names, option phases, and platforms see file \fBxio\&.help\fP\&. 
.br 
.br 

.PP 
.br 

.PP 
\fI\fBFD option group\fP\fP
.PP 
This option group contains options that are applied to a UN*X
style file descriptor, no matter how it was generated\&.
Because all current \fBsocat\fP address types are file descriptor based, these
options may be applied to any address\&. 
.br 
Note: Some of these options are also member of another option group, that
provides another, non\-fd based mechanism\&.
For these options, it depends on the actual address type and its option groups 
which mechanism is used\&. The second, non\-fd based mechanism is prioritized\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWcloexec=<bool>\fP\fP"
Sets the 
\f(CWFD_CLOEXEC\fP
flag with the 
\f(CWfcntl()\fP

This prevents the log file from being filled with useless error messages
when socat is used as a high volume server or proxy where clients often
abort the connection\&.

Normally, socket connections will be ended with \f(CWshutdown(2)\fP which
terminates the socket even if it is shared by multiple processes\&. 
\f(CWclose(2)\fP \(dq\&unlinks\(dq\& the socket from the process but keeps it active as

useful with UDP and other datagram protocols\&. Has been tested against
netcat and socat with option null\-eof\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWnull\-eof\fP\fP"
Normally \fBsocat\fP will ignore empty (zero size payload) packets arriving on

.IP "\fB\f(CWsourceport=<port>\fP\fP"
For outgoing (client) TCP and UDP connections, it sets the source
<port> using an extra 
\f(CWbind()\fP
call\&.
With TCP or UDP listen addresses, socat immediately shuts down the
connection if the client does not use this sourceport (example)\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWlowport\fP\fP"
Outgoing (client) TCP and UDP connections with this option use
an unused random source port between 640 and 1023 incl\&. On UNIX class operating
systems, this requires root privilege, and thus indicates that the
client process is authorized by local root\&.
TCP and UDP listen addresses with this option immediately shut down the
connection if the client does not use a sourceport <= 1023\&.
This mechanism can provide limited authorization under some circumstances\&.

.IP "\fB\f(CWignorecr\fP\fP"
The HTTP protocol requires the use of CR+NL as line terminator\&. When a proxy
server violates this standard, socat might not understand its answer\&. 
This option directs socat to interprete NL as line terminator and
to ignore CR in the answer\&. Nevertheless, socat sends CR+NL to the proxy\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWproxyauth=<username>:<password>\fP\fP"
Provide \(dq\&basic\(dq\& authentication to the proxy server\&. The argument to the
option is used with a \(dq\&Proxy\-Authorization: Base\(dq\& header in base64 encoded
form\&.
.br 
Note: username and password are visible for every user on the local machine
in the process list; username and password are transferred to the proxy
server unencrypted (base64 encoded) and might be sniffed\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWresolve\fP\fP"
Per default, socat sends to the proxy a CONNECT request containing the
target hostname\&. With this option, socat resolves the hostname locally and

10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, or address:mask, e\&.g\&. 10\&.0\&.0\&.0:255\&.0\&.0\&.0 (example); for IPv6, it is [ip6\-address]/bits, e\&.g\&. [::1]/128\&.
If the client address does not match, \fBsocat\fP refuses the connection attempt, issues a warning, and keeps
listening/receiving\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWtcpwrap[=<name>]\fP\fP"
Uses Wietse Venema\(cq\&s libwrap (tcpd) library to determine
if the client is allowed to connect\&. The configuration files are
/etc/hosts\&.allow and /etc/hosts\&.deny per default, see \(dq\&man 5 hosts_access\(dq\&
for more information\&. The optional <name> (type string)
is passed to the wrapper functions as daemon process name (example)\&. 
If omitted, the basename of socats invocation (argv[0]) is passed\&. 
If both tcpwrap and range options are applied to an address, both
conditions must be fulfilled to allow the connection\&.

\fI\fBPTY option group\fP\fP
.PP 
These options are intended for use with the pty address
type\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWlink=<filename>\fP\fP"
Generates a symbolic link that points to the actual pseudo terminal
(pty)\&. This might help 
to solve the problem that ptys are generated with more or less
unpredictable names, making it difficult to directly access the socat
generated pty automatically\&. With this option, the user can specify a \(dq\&fix\(dq\&
point in the file hierarchy that helps him to access the actual pty
(example)\&.
Beginning with \fBsocat\fP version 1\&.4\&.3, the symbolic link is removed when
the address is closed (but see option unlink\-close)\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWwait\-slave\fP\fP"
Blocks the open phase until a process opens the slave side of the pty\&.
Usually, socat continues after generating the pty with opening the next
address or with entering the transfer loop\&. With the wait\-slave option,
socat waits until some process opens the slave side of the pty before
continuing\&. 
This option only works if the operating system provides the \f(CWpoll()\fP
system call\&. And it depends on an undocumented behaviour of pty\(cq\&s, so it
does not work on all operating systems\&. It has successfully been tested on
Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and on Tru64 with openpty\&. 
.IP "\fB\f(CWpty\-interval=<seconds>\fP\fP"
When the wait\-slave option is set, socat
periodically checks the HUP condition using \f(CWpoll()\fP to find if the pty\(cq\&s
slave side has been opened\&. The default polling interval is 1s\&. Use the
pty\-interval option [timeval] to change this value\&.

.PP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWcipher=<cipherlist>\fP\fP"
Selects the list of ciphers that may be used for the connection\&.
See the man page of 
\f(CWciphers\fP
, section \fBCIPHER LIST FORMAT\fP, for
detailed information about syntax, values, and default of <cipherlist>\&.
.br 
Several cipher strings may be given, separated by \(cq\&:\(cq\&\&.
Some simple cipher strings:
.IP "3DES"
Uses a cipher suite with triple DES\&.
.IP "MD5"
Uses a cipher suite with MD5\&.
.IP "aNULL"
Uses a cipher suite without authentication\&.
.IP "NULL"
Does not use encryption\&.
.IP "HIGH"
Uses a cipher suite with \(dq\&high\(dq\& encryption\&.
Note that the peer must support the selected property, or the negotiation
will fail\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWmethod=<ssl\-method>\fP\fP"
This option is based on deprecated functions and is only available when
\fBsocat\fP was build with option \f(CW\-\-with\-openssl\-method\fP\&.
Sets the protocol version to be used\&. Valid strings (not case sensitive)
are:  
.IP "\f(CWSSL2\fP"
Select SSL protocol version 2\&.
.IP "\f(CWSSL3\fP"
Select SSL protocol version 3\&.
.IP "\f(CWSSL23\fP"
Select the best available SSL or TLS protocol\&.
.IP "\f(CWTLS1\fP"
Select TLS protocol version 1\&.
.IP "\f(CWTLS1\&.1\fP"
Select TLS protocol version 1\&.1\&.
.IP "\f(CWTLS1\&.2\fP"
Select TLS protocol version 1\&.2\&.
When this option is not provided OpenSSL negotiates the mothod with its
peer\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWverify=<bool>\fP\fP"
Controls check of the peer\(cq\&s certificate\&. Default is 1 (true)\&. Disabling
verify might open your socket for everyone, making the encryption useless!
.IP "\fB\f(CWcert=<filename>\fP\fP"
Specifies the file with the certificate and private key for authentication\&. 
The certificate must be in OpenSSL format (*\&.pem)\&. 
With openssl\-listen, use of this option is strongly
recommended\&. Except with cipher aNULL, \(dq\&no shared ciphers\(dq\& error will
occur when no certificate is given\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWkey=<filename>\fP\fP"
Specifies the file with the private key\&. The private key may be in this
file or in the file given with the cert option\&. The party that has
to proof that it is the owner of a certificate needs the private key\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWdhparams=<filename>\fP\fP"
Specifies the file with the Diffie Hellman parameters\&. These parameters may
also be in the file given with the cert
option in which case the dhparams option is not needed\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWcafile=<filename>\fP\fP"
Specifies the file with the trusted (root) authority certificates\&. The file
must be in PEM format and should contain one or more certificates\&. The party
that checks the authentication of its peer trusts only certificates that are
in this file\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWcapath=<dirname>\fP\fP"
Specifies the directory with the trusted (root) certificates\&. The directory
must contain certificates in PEM format and their hashes (see OpenSSL
documentation) 
.IP "\fB\f(CWegd=<filename>\fP\fP"
On some systems, openssl requires an explicit source of random data\&. Specify
the socket name where an entropy gathering daemon like egd provides random
data, e\&.g\&. /dev/egd\-pool\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWpseudo\fP\fP"
On systems where openssl cannot find an entropy source and where no entropy
gathering daemon can be utilized, this option activates a mechanism for
providing pseudo entropy\&. This is achieved by taking the current time in
microseconds for feeding the libc pseudo random number generator with an
initial value\&. openssl is then feeded with output from random() calls\&.
.br 
NOTE:This mechanism is not sufficient for generation of secure keys!
.IP "\fB\f(CWcompress\fP\fP"
Enable or disable the use of compression for a connection\&. Setting this to
\(dq\&none\(dq\& disables compression, setting it to \(dq\&auto\(dq\& lets OpenSSL choose the best
available algorithm supported by both parties\&. The default is to not touch any
compression\-related settings\&.
NOTE: Requires OpenSSL 0\&.9\&.8 or higher and disabling compression with
OpenSSL 0\&.9\&.8 affects all new connections in the process\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWcommonname=<string>\fP\fP"
Specify the commonname that the peer certificate must match\&. With
OPENSSL\-CONNECT address this overrides the
given hostname or IP target address; with
OPENSSL\-LISTEN this turns on check of peer
certificates commonname\&. This option has only meaning when option
verify is not disabled and the chosen cipher
provides a peer certificate\&.
.IP "\fB\f(CWfips\fP\fP"
Enables FIPS mode if compiled in\&. For info about the FIPS encryption
implementation standard see http://oss\-institute\&.org/fips\-faq\&.html\&. 
This mode might require that the involved certificates are generated with a
FIPS enabled version of openssl\&. Setting or clearing this option on one
socat address affects all OpenSSL addresses of this process\&.

.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- TCP4:www\&.domain\&.org:80\fP\fP"

.IP 
transfers data between STDIO (\-) and a
TCP4 connection to port 80 of host 
www\&.domain\&.org\&. This example results in an interactive connection similar to
telnet or netcat\&. The stdin terminal parameters are not changed, so you may

.IP 
this is similar to the previous example, but you can edit the current line in a
bash like manner (READLINE) and use the
history file \&.http_history; \fBsocat\fP prints messages about
progress (\-d \-d)\&. The  port is specified by service name
(www), and correct network line termination characters

.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat TCP4\-LISTEN:www TCP4:www\&.domain\&.org:www\fP\fP"

.IP 
installs a simple TCP port forwarder\&. With
TCP4\-LISTEN it listens on local port \(dq\&www\(dq\& until a

\.fi
.IP 
TCP port forwarder, each side bound to another local IP address
(bind)\&. This example handles an almost
arbitrary number of parallel or consecutive connections by
fork\(cq\&ing a new 
process after each 
\f(CWaccept()\fP
\&. It provides a little security by
su\(cq\&ing to user 
nobody after forking; it only permits connections from the private 10 network
(range); due to reuseaddr, it
allows immediate restart after master process\(cq\&s termination, even if some child
sockets are not completely shut down\&.
With \-lmlocal2, socat logs to stderr until successfully
reaching the accept loop\&. Further logging is directed to syslog with facility
local2\&.

\fBsocat TCP4-LISTEN:5555,fork,tcpwrap=script \\ 
EXEC:/bin/myscript,chroot=/home/sandbox,su-d=sandbox,pty,stderr\fP
\.fi
.IP 
a simple server that accepts connections
(TCP4\-LISTEN) and fork\(cq\&s a new
child process for each connection; every child acts as single relay\&. 
The client must match the rules for daemon process name \(dq\&script\(dq\& in
/etc/hosts\&.allow and /etc/hosts\&.deny, otherwise it is refused access (see \(dq\&man
5 hosts_access\(dq\&)\&.
For EXEC\(cq\&uting the program, the child process
chroot\(cq\&s 
to \fB/home/sandbox\fP, su\(cq\&s to user sandbox, and then starts 
the program \fB/home/sandbox/bin/myscript\fP\&. \fBSocat\fP and
myscript communicate via a pseudo tty (pty); myscript\(cq\&s
stderr is redirected to stdout,
so its error messages are transferred via \fBsocat\fP to the connected client\&.

TCP4:mail.relay.org:25,crnl,bind=alias1.server.org,mss=512\fP
\.fi
.IP 
\fBmail\&.sh\fP is a shell script, distributed with \fBsocat\fP, that implements a
simple 
SMTP client\&. It is programmed to \(dq\&speak\(dq\& SMTP on its FDs 3 (in) and 4 (out)\&.
The fdin and fdout options tell \fBsocat\fP
to use these FDs for communication with 
the program\&. Because mail\&.sh inherits stdin and stdout while \fBsocat\fP does not
use them, the script can read a
mail body from stdin\&. \fBSocat\fP makes alias1 your local source address
(bind), cares for correct network line termination
(crnl) and sends  
at most 512 data bytes per packet (mss)\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \-,escape=0x0f /dev/ttyS0,rawer,crnl\fP\fP"

.IP 
opens an interactive connection via the serial line, e\&.g\&. for talking with a
modem\&. rawer sets the console\(cq\&s and
ttyS0\(cq\&s terminal parameters to practicable values, crnl 
converts to correct newline characters\&. escape allows
terminating the socat process with character control\-O\&.

SOCKS4:host.victim.org:127.0.0.1:6000,socksuser=nobody,sourceport=20\fP
\.fi
.IP 
with UNIX\-LISTEN, \fBsocat\fP opens a listening
UNIX domain socket \fB/tmp/\&.X11\-unix/X1\fP\&. This path corresponds 
to local XWindow display :1 on your machine, so XWindow client connections to
DISPLAY=:1 are accepted\&. \fBSocat\fP then speaks with
the SOCKS4 server host\&.victim\&.org that might permit 
sourceport 20 based connections due to an FTP related
weakness in its static IP filters\&. \fBSocat\fP
pretends to be invoked by socksuser nobody, and
requests to be connected to 
loopback port 6000 (only weak sockd configurations will allow this)\&. So we get
a connection to the victims XWindow server and, if it does not require MIT
cookies or Kerberos authentication, we can start work\&. Please note that there
can only be one connection at a time, because TCP can establish only one
session with a given set of addresses and ports\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \-u /tmp/readdata,seek\-end=0,ignoreeof \-\fP\fP"

.IP 
this is an example for unidirectional data transfer
(\-u)\&. \fBSocat\fP transfers data 
from file /tmp/readdata (implicit address GOPEN), starting
at its current end (seek\-end=0 lets \fBsocat\fP start 
reading at current end of file; use seek=0 or no
seek option to first read the existing data) in a \(dq\&tail \-f\(dq\& like mode
(ignoreeof)\&. The \(dq\&file\(dq\&

.IP 
EXEC\(cq\&utes an ssh session to server\&. Uses a pty for communication between \fBsocat\fP and
ssh, makes it ssh\(cq\&s controlling tty (ctty), 
and makes this pty the owner of
a new process group (setsid), so ssh accepts the password from \fBsocat\fP\&.

\fBsocat -u TCP4-LISTEN:3334,reuseaddr,fork \\ 
OPEN:/tmp/in.log,creat,append\fP
\.fi
.IP 
implements a simple network based message collector\&. 
For each client connecting to port 3334, a new child process is generated (option fork)\&.
All data sent by the clients are append\(cq\&ed to the file /tmp/in\&.log\&.
If the file does not exist, socat creat\(cq\&s it\&. 
Option reuseaddr allows immediate restart of the server
process\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat READLINE,noecho=\(cq\&[Pp]assword:\(cq\& EXEC:\(cq\&ftp ftp\&.server\&.com\(cq\&,pty,setsid,ctty\fP\fP"

.IP 
wraps a command line history (READLINE) around the EXEC\(cq\&uted ftp client utility\&.
This allows editing and reuse of FTP commands for relatively comfortable
browsing through the ftp directory hierarchy\&. The password is echoed!
pty is required to have ftp issue a prompt\&.
Nevertheless, there may occur some confusion with the password and FTP

.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- SSL:server:4443,cafile=server\&.crt,cert=client\&.pem\fP\fP"

.IP 
is an OpenSSL client that tries to establish a secure connection to an SSL
server\&. Option cafile specifies a file that
contains trust certificates: we trust the server only when it presents one of
these certificates and proofs that it owns the related private key\&. 
Otherwise the connection is terminated\&.
With cert a file containing the client certificate
and the associated private key is specified\&. This is required in case the
server wishes a client authentication; many Internet servers do not\&.
.br 
The first address (\(cq\&\-\(cq\&) can be replaced by almost any other socat address\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat OPENSSL\-LISTEN:4443,reuseaddr,pf=ip4,fork,cert=server\&.pem,cafile=client\&.crt PIPE\fP\fP"

.IP 
is an OpenSSL server that accepts TCP connections, presents the certificate
from the file server\&.pem and forces the client to present a certificate that is
verified against cafile\&.crt\&.
.br 
The second address (\(cq\&PIPE\(cq\&) can be replaced by almost any other socat
address\&.
.br 
For instructions on generating and distributing OpenSSL keys and certificates
see the additional socat docu \f(CWsocat\-openssl\&.txt\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWecho |socat \-u \- file:/tmp/bigfile,create,largefile,seek=100000000000\fP\fP"

.IP 
creates a 100GB sparse file; this requires a file system type that
supports this (ext2, ext3, reiserfs, jfs; not minix, vfat)\&. The operation of
writing 1 byte might take long (reiserfs: some minutes; ext2: \(dq\&no\(dq\& time), and
the resulting file can consume some disk space with just its inodes (reiserfs:
2MB; ext2: 16KB)\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat tcp\-l:7777,reuseaddr,fork system:\(cq\&filan \-i 0 \-s >&2\(cq\&,nofork\fP\fP"

.IP 
listens for incoming TCP connections on port 7777\&. For each accepted
connection, invokes a shell\&. This shell has its stdin and stdout directly
connected to the TCP socket (nofork)\&.  The shell starts filan and lets it print the socket addresses to
stderr (your terminal window)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWecho \-e \(dq\&\e0\e14\e0\e0\ec\(dq\& |socat \-u \- file:/usr/bin/squid\&.exe,seek=0x00074420\fP\fP"

.IP 
functions as primitive binary editor: it writes the 4 bytes 000 014 000 000 to
the executable /usr/bin/squid at offset 0x00074420 (this is a real world patch
to make the squid executable from Cygwin run under Windows, actual per May 2004)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- tcp:www\&.blackhat\&.org:31337,readbytes=1000\fP\fP"

.IP 
connects to an unknown service and prevents being flooded\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \-U TCP:target:9999,end\-close TCP\-L:8888,reuseaddr,fork\fP\fP"

.IP 
merges data arriving from different TCP streams on port 8888 to just one stream
to target:9999\&. The end\-close option prevents the child
processes forked off by the second address from terminating the shared
connection to 9999 (close(2) just unlinks the inode which stays active as long
as the parent process lives; shutdown(2) would actively terminate the
connection)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- UDP4\-DATAGRAM:192\&.168\&.1\&.0:123,sp=123,broadcast,range=192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24\fP\fP"

.IP 
sends a broadcast to the network 192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24 and receives the replies of the
timeservers there\&. Ignores NTP packets from hosts outside this network\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- SOCKET\-DATAGRAM:2:2:17:x007bxc0a80100x0000000000000000,bind=x007bx00000000x0000000000000000,setsockopt\-int=1:6:1,range=x0000xc0a80100x0000000000000000:x0000xffffff00x0000000000000000\fP\fP"

.IP 
is semantically equivalent to the previous
example, but all parameters are
specified in generic form\&. the value 6 of setsockopt\-int is the Linux value for
\f(CWSO_BROADCAST\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- IP4\-DATAGRAM:255\&.255\&.255\&.255:44,broadcast,range=10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8\fP\fP"

.IP 
sends a broadcast to the local network(s) using protocol 44\&. Accepts replies
from the private address range only\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \- UDP4\-DATAGRAM:224\&.255\&.0\&.1:6666,bind=:6666,ip\-add\-membership=224\&.255\&.0\&.1:eth0\fP\fP"

.IP 
transfers data from stdin to the specified multicast address using UDP\&. Both
local and remote ports are 6666\&. Tells the interface eth0 to also accept
multicast packets of the given group\&. Multiple hosts on the local network can
run this command, so all data sent by any of the hosts will be received
by all the other ones\&. Note that there are many possible reasons for failure,
including IP\-filters, routing issues, wrong interface selection by the
operating system, bridges, or a badly configured switch\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat TCP:host2:4443 TUN:192\&.168\&.255\&.1/24,up\fP\fP"

.IP 
establishes one side of a virtual (but not private!) network with host2 where a
similar process might run, with UDP\-L and tun address 192\&.168\&.255\&.2\&. They can
reach each other using the addresses 192\&.168\&.255\&.1 and 192\&.168\&.255\&.2\&. Note that
streaming eg\&. via TCP or SSL does not guarantee to retain packet boundaries and
may thus cause packet loss\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat PTY,link=/var/run/ppp,rawer INTERFACE:hdlc0\fP\fP"

.IP 
circumvents the problem that pppd requires a serial device and thus might not
be able to work on a synchronous line that is represented by a network device\&.
socat creates a PTY to make pppd happy, binds to the network
interface \f(CWhdlc0\fP, and can transfer data between
both devices\&. Use pppd on device \f(CW/var/run/ppp\fP then\&.
.IP

.IP 
creates a simple HTTP echo server: each HTTP client that connects gets a valid
HTTP reply that contains information about the client address and port as it is
seen by the server host, the host address (which might vary on multihomed
servers), and the original client request\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB\f(CWsocat \-d \-d UDP4\-RECVFROM:9999,so\-broadcast,so\-timestamp,ip\-pktinfo,ip\-recverr,ip\-recvopts,ip\-recvtos,ip\-recvttl!!\- SYSTEM:\(cq\&export; sleep 1\(cq\& |grep SOCAT\fP\fP"

.IP 
waits for an incoming UDP packet on port 9999 and prints the environment 
variables provided by socat\&. On BSD based systems you have to replace
\f(CWip\-pktinfo\fP with \f(CWip\-recvdstaddr\fP,\f(CWip\-recvif\fP\&. Especially interesting is
SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR: it contains the target address of the packet which may be a
unicast, multicast, or broadcast address\&.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

.PP 
\fBSocat\fP uses a logging mechanism that allows filtering messages by severity\&. The
severities provided are more or less compatible to the appropriate syslog
priority\&. With one or up to four occurrences of the \-d command line option, the
lowest priority of messages that are issued can be selected\&. Each message
contains a single uppercase character specifying the messages severity (one of
F, E, W, N, I, or D)
.PP 
.IP "FATAL:"
Conditions that require unconditional and immediate program termination\&.
.IP "ERROR:"
Conditions that prevent proper program processing\&. Usually the
program is terminated (see option \-s)\&.

happens\&. Allows monitoring the lifecycles of file descriptors\&.
.IP "DEBUG:"
Description of how the program works, all system or library calls and their results\&.

.PP 
Log messages can be written to stderr, to a file, or to syslog\&.
.PP 
On exit, \fBsocat\fP gives status 0 if it terminated due to EOF or inactivity
timeout, with a positive value on error, and with a negative value on fatal
error\&.

Input variables carry information from the environment to socat, output
variables are set by socat for use in executed scripts and programs\&.
.PP 
In the output variables beginning with \(dq\&SOCAT\(dq\& this prefix is actually replaced
by the upper case name of the executable or the value of option
\-lp\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fBSOCAT_DEFAULT_LISTEN_IP\fP (input)"
