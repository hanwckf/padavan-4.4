file obsolete after migration to git

20040425

a) the main CVS module "poptop" is no longer the stable version, it is
   all versions, and the HEAD is unstable.

b) CVS tags have been added:

   poptop-1_1_3-a is the previous stable version tag.
       (before merging 1.1.4 changes with 1.1.3 head)
   pptpd-1_2_0-b1 is the first beta of the new release.
   pptpd-1_2_0-b2 is the second beta of the new release.
   pptpd-1_2_0-b3 is the third beta of the new release.

   See "man cvs" for how to check out or track a tag release.

c) the secondary CVS module "poptop-1.1.3" is deprecated, but HEAD
   contains 1.1.4-b4.

d) 1.1.4-b4 plus a few minor edits has been released to a small test
   team as 1.2.0-b2.  Results will be published when known.  Other
   testers welcome; write to me.
