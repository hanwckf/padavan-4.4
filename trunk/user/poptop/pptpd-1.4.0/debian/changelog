pptpd (1.1.4.0b4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally acknowledge the bugs fixed in the NMUs:
    Closes: #132819 (Build-Depends on devhelper)
    Closes: #126712 (Mark /etc/init.d/pptpd as conffile)
    Closes: #57849 (Remove recommends line)
  * Enable the MSCHAP and MPPE options again in the default config, but now
    changed for the new upstream pppd syntax.
  * Also include the new upstream source in the upload - 
    dpkg-buildpackage was confused by the version number.
  * Enhance the init script to: 
    - Include a "status" option.
    - Force pptpd to close its file descriptors.
    Closes: #189426: pptpd does not close/redirect stdout and stderr
  * Use po-debconf for debconf translations and add pt_BR and FR translations.
    However, debconf is still not used for autoconfig until I find time to 
    implement the config script properly. It will come, soon ;)
    Also fix some english short descriptions - thanks for pointing that out.
    Closes: #191703: Update packaging to use the newer gettext-based debconf 
            template translation system
    Closes: #208049: Please switch to gettext-based debconf templates
    Closes: #211273: French translation of gettext debconf template
    I will leave #209082 open until the config script works....
  * Also ship the README.bcrelay file in the binary package.
  * Move the HOWTO-IPX+PPTP.txt file from the html/ directory to the normal
    doc directory.
    Closes: #220707: CVS directory, and non-html in 'html' dir
  * Document that IP forwarding needs to be enabled, but refer to 
    /etc/network/options instead of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward.
    Closes: #168718: Documentation has no reference to 
            /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

pptpd (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    The debconf support is still disabled because I do not have time to
    write a perl script that can change the configuration files (only 2 files
    need to be changed) thet is really safe (i.e. it does not mess with manual
    configuration in those files). If anybody can contribute, I would be very
    happy.
