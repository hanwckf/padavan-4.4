# Multiple sector I/O. a feature of most modern IDE hard drives,
# permitting the transfer of multiple sectors per I/O interrupt,
# rather than the usual one sector per interrupt.  When this feature
# is enabled, it typically reduces operating system overhead for disk
# I/O by 30-50%.  On many systems, it also provides increased non-DMA
# data throughput of anywhere from 5% to 50%.  Some drives, however
# (most notably the older WD Caviar series), seem to run slower with
# multiple mode enabled. Under rare circumstances, such failures can
# result in # massive filesystem corruption. USE WITH CAUTION AND BACKUP.
# This is the sector count for multiple sector I/O - the "-m" option

# MULTIPLE_IO=8

# (E)IDE 32-bit I/O support (to interface card)

# EIDE_32BIT=1

# Enable drive read-lookahead

# LOOKAHEAD=1

# Add extra parameters here if wanted
# Other flags you might want to experiment with are -u1, -A1 and -W1
# See the hdparm manpage (man hdparm) for details and more options.
