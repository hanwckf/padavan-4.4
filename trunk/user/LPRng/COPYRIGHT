Under the terms of the OpenSSL license, the following statement is included:

This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)

If you wish  to distribute the LPRng source code or binaries of any
of the programs in the LPRng packages under terms of the GNU license,
then when any package or portion of the LPRng is configured to use
any facility or utility of the OpenSSL distribution, the additional
following clause will be applied, as recommended in the OpenSSL
0.9.6c release FAQ:

"This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption that
compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed."
