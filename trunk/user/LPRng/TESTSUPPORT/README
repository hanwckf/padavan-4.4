These files set up a mini-lpr system.  The following assumptions are made.

1. You are going to install all the working files in /tmp/LPD.
2. You will copy all of the lpd files as well to /tmp/LPD
3. You will set your path to:
    PATH=/tmp/LPD;$PATH    Bourne Shell
    set path=(/tmp/LPD $path )  C Shell
4. You can now run the LPD software in test mode.

Rough Cut Installation:
 This is for the adventurous!

1. Go back to your executable directory,  and run checkpc -T /dev/<serialline>
   Read the results of the tests.  If these do not work,  read the
   instructions in src/Makefile or given by the checkpc output. These
   tests must pass or the test version will not really work.
   (Note: the SETUID and serial line locking are not really essential, but
   help on systems).  See details in top level README.


2. set HOST to the FQDN
   set USER to your user name
   Bourne Shell           C Shell
    HOST=host.domail       setenv HOST host.domain
    USER=yourname          setenv USER yourname

3. run the Makefile in the TESTSUPPORT
   cd TESTSUPPORT
   make

4. Set your path to have /tmp/LPD as the first entry
   Bourne Shell           C Shell
    PATH=/tmp/LPD;$PATH     set path=(/tmp/LPD $path)

5. cd /tmp/LPD
   Start up the server
   lpd -F -D2  (in one window or whatever)         

   Try out some utilities
   lpq
   lpq -a
   echo hi |lpr
   lpq

6. Kill off the server
   run:
     checkpc -f
   to update the ownerships, etc.
   Repeat the previous step in testing.

7. You can now play with the test setup: trying modify the lpd.perms
