 ** RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message Digest Algorithm             **
 ** Created: 2/17/90 RLR                                             **
 ** Revised: 12/27/90 SRD,AJ,BSK,JT Reference C version              **
 ** Revised (for MD5): RLR 4/27/91                                   **
 **   -- G modified to have y&~z instead of y&z                      **
 **   -- FF, GG, HH modified to add in last register done            **
 **   -- Access pattern: round 2 works mod 5, round 3 works mod 3    **
 **   -- distinct additive constant for each step                    **
 **   -- round 4 added, working mod 7                                **
