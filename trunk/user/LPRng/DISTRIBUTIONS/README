 Distribution Support

The files in this directory are used as a starting point for 
various distributions.  See the READMEs in each distribution.
General approach:

a) Copy the LPRng distribution to the target system.
b) tar zxvf LPRng-....tgz 
c) cd LPRng-.../DISTRIBUTION/system
d) make checkit   or   make all

There is a pretty good explanation of what is being done
on each of the systems in the DISTRIBUTION/system/README file.
