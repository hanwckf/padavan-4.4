This is a set of scripts to make a Solaris pkg distribtion

UNPACK    - test script for regression testing
            This allows you to copy the LPRng distribution
            to a directory on a Solaris system and then
            do 'sh UNPACK'.  This will generate a package

Scripts used to generate the package
   copyright
   i.preserve
   inetd.conf
   prototype.pre
   r.preserve

Makefile  - makefile that does the work
   make clean all
      Builds a package.

   In order to do this we horribly abuse the various
   things that you would normally expect a Solaris Package
   generation script to do.

   a)  We first compile and install the LPRng software in
       a temporary location (i.e. /var/tmp/LPRng-...) so that
       this contains only the LPRng installation files
   b)  We use this to generation a packing list
   c)  We then get the various postinstall and preremove
       scripts from the generated stuff and put them into
       the files in the current directory.
   d)  We make the package.

You might also want to try:
   make checkit
    - checks build and makes package
   make removeit
    - removes package
   make installit
    - installs package
