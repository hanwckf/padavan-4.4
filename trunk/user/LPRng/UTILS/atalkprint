# This is a template file for hooking up printing to a remote
#  printer that needs a communication program
#
#  Modified by Patrick Powell <papowell@astart.com> for the LPRngTool
#   Note 1: the general.config file is assumed to be in the current directory
#   Note 2: entries can be in any order in the file
#
# This script is an input filter for printcap printing on a unix machine. It
# uses the smbclient program to print the file to the specified smb-based 
# server and service.
# For example you could have a printcap entry like this
#
# atalk:lp=/dev/null:sd=/usr/spool/lpd/atalk:if=/usr/local/filters/atalkprint
# 
# which would create a unix printer called "atalk" that will print via this 
# script.
#
# The script gets its information from the general.config file
# file in the printer spool directory or the atalk_options line
# or from the printcap 'atalk_options' line
# The options used are:
#   host=host           host for printing
#   printer=printer     printer
#   username=printer     printer
# example: general.config file -
#    host="host"
#    printer="lp"
#
# :atalk_options= host="host" printer="lp"
#
# Should read the following variables set in the auth file:
#   username=username       for authentication
#   password=password   for authentication

if [ -f ./general.cfg ] ; then
	. ./general.cfg
fi
options=`echo "${PRINTCAP_ENTRY}" | sed -n 's/:atalk_options=//p' `
if [ -n "$options" ] ; then
	eval export $options
fi

# now you simply use the paramters you have extracted
#
/usr/bin/pap -p "$username:$printer@$host"
