    Eliminate make warnings when building rpcbind and rpcinfo:
    
    make[3]: Circular security.o <- security.o dependency dropped.
    make[3]: Circular util.o <- security.o dependency dropped.
    make[3]: Circular util.o <- util.o dependency dropped.

    and so on.
    
    Apparently src/Makefile.am needs either a list of source files or a
    list of object files, but not both.

    rpcbind: Squelch a compiler warning
    
    Remove a needless pointer-to-integer conversion.  getnameinfo(3) wants
    a size value greater than or equal to offsetof(struct sockaddr_un,
    sun_path).  Since pointers can be different sizes depending on the
    hardware platform, let's make this a simple constant instead.
    
    This eliminates the compiler warning:
    
    rpcinfo.c: In function sa_len
    rpcinfo.c:666: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
    
    when building on x86-64.

    Properly identify local root user over ipv4/v6
    
    When an application registers a service through an inet transport,
    rpcbind will always treat the owner as "unknown".  This allows random
    users to unregister such services, and replace them with their own -
    man-in-the-middle attacks for services like ypserv are trivial.
    
    This patch changes pmapproc_change to check whether the call originated
    from a priviliged local port, and if that is the case, it identifies the
    caller as "superuser".
    
    This mimics the way the current Linux portmap behaves.

    Fix debug output in is_loopback
    
    The security check in is_loopback wants to print the source
    port number, assuming that the remote address is always a
    sockaddr_in - which is silly. Move the printf into the
    address family specific switch statement.

    The debugging code in pmapproc_change prints the contents of
    the "struct pmap" argument before decoding it, which results
    in random garbage being displayed.

    Fix for warm start
    
    If you use rpcbind with the warm start functionality, it will load *all*
    registrations from the warm start files, including those for rpcbind
    and portmap. This is wrong, as that information may be stale - a user
    may specifically edit the netconfig file and restart rpcbind to change
    the transports it supports. In this case we want the registrations
    to match the status quo, rather than the status before the restart.
    
    This patch changes read_warmstart() to merge the existing rpcb/pmap
    lists, which contain only the rpcbind/portmap entries, with the saved
    start lists, but ignoring any rpcbind/portmap entries present in the
    warm start files.

    Support portmap on AF_LOCAL, too
    
    This patch makes sure we support portmap (aka rpcbind v2) on ipv4 _and_
    af_local.  That allows rpcbind to identify the owner of a socket much
    better than by relying on privileged ports to tell root from non-root
    users.

    Simplify port live check in pmap_svc.c
    
    There's some hack in pmap_getport that will cause a service
    to be unregistered from the portmap list if we find the port
    is no longer in use. Apart from being a gross hack, it is
    also a rather inefficient hack. Since we now restrict pmap
    emulation to IPv4, we know the address is always 0.0.0.0,
    so no need to mess with uaddr strings.
    
    (The bind_check code is a huge messy no-op anyway, since
    all ports are added with bind_check = FALSE).

    Change how we decide on the netids to use for portmap
    
    The current code will try to use either udp or udp6, and either tcp or
    tcp6 for its portmap emulation code. Enabling eg both tcp6 and tcp in
    the netconfig file will cause error messages, and cause rpcbind to not
    register itself on the second transport (tcp).
    
    This is not what we want.
    
    I believe portmap emulation should only be enabled over IPv4.
    There's no point in enabling it over IPv6.

    Introduce helpers for ipprot/netid mapping
    
    There's a couple of places in the portmap emulation code
    where we translate between ip protocol numbers and netids.
    Encapsulate these in two helper functions:
    
    extern char *pmap_ipprot2netid(int);
    extern int pmap_netid2ipprot(const char *);
