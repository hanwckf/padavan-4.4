     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms may be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     For compression the application must provide the output buffer and
  may optionally provide the input buffer for optimization. For decompression,
  the application must provide the input buffer and may optionally provide
  the output buffer for optimization.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

   zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor

*/


extern int deflate OF((z_stream *strm, int flush));
/*
  Performs one or both of the following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).
    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.

  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out
  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
  (avail_out == 0), or after each call of deflate().

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, the current compression
  block is terminated and flushed to the output buffer so that the
  decompressor can get all input data available so far. For method 9, a future
  variant on method 8, the current block will be flushed but not terminated.
  If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, the compression block is terminated, a
  special marker is output and the compression dictionary is discarded; this
  is useful to allow the decompressor to synchronize if one compressed block
  has been damaged (see inflateSync below).  Flushing degrades compression and
  so should be used only when necessary.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can
  seriously degrade the compression. If deflate returns with avail_out == 0,
  this function must be called again with the same value of the flush
  parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is
  complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out).

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PACKET_FLUSH, the compression
  block is terminated, and a zero-length stored block is output,
  omitting the length bytes (the effect of this is that the 3-bit type
  code 000 for a stored block is output, and the output is then
  byte-aligned).  This is designed for use at the end of a PPP packet.
  In addition, if the current compression block contains all the data
  since the last Z_PACKET_FLUSH, it is never output as a stored block.
  If the current compression block output as a static or dynamic block
  would not be at least `minCompression' bytes smaller than the
  original data, then nothing is output for that block.  (The type
  code for the zero-length stored block is still output, resulting in
  a single zero byte being output for the whole packet.)
  `MinCompression' is a parameter to deflateInit2, or 0 if deflateInit
  is used.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, all pending input is processed,
  all pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there
  was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be
  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no
  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After
  deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the
  stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.
  
    Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression
  is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least
  0.1% larger than avail_in plus 12 bytes.  If deflate does not return
  Z_STREAM_END, then it must be called again as described above.

    deflate() may update data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_ASCII or Z_BINARY). In doubt, the data is considered
  binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect
  the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible.

    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() always provides as much output as possible
    (until there is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate().

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH or Z_PACKET_FLUSH,
  inflate flushes as much output as possible to the output buffer. The
  flushing behavior of inflate is not specified for values of the flush
  parameter other than Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_PACKET_FLUSH or Z_FINISH, but the
  current implementation actually flushes as much output as possible
  anyway.  For Z_PACKET_FLUSH, inflate checks that once all the input data
  has been consumed, it is expecting to see the length field of a stored
  block; if not, it returns Z_DATA_ERROR.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster routine
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the
  compressed data has been reached and all uncompressed output has been
  produced, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted, Z_STREAM_ERROR if
  the stream structure was inconsistent (for example if next_in or next_out
  was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if no
  progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the output buffer
  when Z_FINISH is used. In the Z_DATA_ERROR case, the application may then
  call inflateSync to look for a good compression block.  */

/*   
     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_in, zalloc and zfree must be initialized before by the caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method. It must be 8 in this
   version of the library. (Method 9 will allow a 64K history buffer and
   partial block flushes.)

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library (the value 16 will be allowed for method 9). Larger
   values of this parameter result in better compression at the expense of
   memory usage. The default value is 15 if deflateInit is used instead.

    The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but
   is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory
   for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory
   usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use
   the value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data
   produced by a filter (or predictor), or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman
   encoding only (no string match).  Filtered data consists mostly of small
   values with a somewhat random distribution. In this case, the
   compression algorithm is tuned to compress them better. The strategy
   parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of
   the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.

     The minCompression parameter specifies the minimum reduction in size
   required for a compressed block to be output when Z_PACKET_FLUSH is
   used (see the description of deflate above).

     If next_in is not null, the library will use this buffer to hold also
   some history information; the buffer must either hold the entire input
   data, or have at least 1<<(windowBits+1) bytes and be writable. If next_in
   is null, the library will allocate its own history buffer (and leave next_in
   null). next_out need not be provided here but must be provided by the
   application for the next call of deflate().

     If the history buffer is provided by the application, next_in must
   must never be changed by the application since the compressor maintains
   information inside this buffer from call to call; the application
   must provide more input only by increasing avail_in. next_in is always
   reset by the library in this case.

      deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was
   not enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as
   an invalid method). msg is set to null if there is no error message.

   return the updated checksum. If buf is NULL, this function returns
   the required initial value for the checksum.
   An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed
   much faster. Usage example:

     uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
     }
     if (adler != original_adler) error();
