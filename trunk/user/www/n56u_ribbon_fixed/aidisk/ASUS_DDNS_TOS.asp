<p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>

<p>THE MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THIS WEBSITE AND THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT THE MEMBER'S SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. ASUSTeK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ASUSTeK MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET THE MEMBER'S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; NOR DOES ASUSTeK MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.

ASUSTeK MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR IN ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY THE MEMBER FROM ASUSTeK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.</p>

<p>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>

<p>ASUSTeK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES OR RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASE OR OBTAINED OR DOMAINS MOVED OR RESULTING FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF THE MEMBER'S TRANSMISSIONS OF DATA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE, EVEN IF ASUSTeK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>7. HOST CONTENT AND OTHER LIMITATIONS</p>

<p>ASUSTeK assumes no responsibility for the content of any material located on the hosts provided from the Service. ASUSTeK has no control over these websites or other material hosted on external hosts; however, ASUSTeK retains the right, on ASUSTeK’s sole discretion, to determine whether or not the Member's conduct is consistent with the letter and spirit of the AUP and may terminate the Service if the Member's conduct is found to be inconsistent with the AUP.</p>

<p>8. MEMBER CONDUCT</p>

<p>The Member is solely responsible for the contents of his/her usage of the Service. The Member's use of the Service is subject to all applicable local, state, federal, and     international laws and regulations. The Member agrees: (1) to comply with all local, state, and federal laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States through the service; (2) not to use the Service for illegal purposes; (3) not to interfere with or disrupt networks connected to the Service; and (4) to comply with all regulations, policies, and procedures of networks connected to the Service. The Service makes use of the Internet's DNS protocol to create and delegate domains; therefore, the Member's conduct is subject to Internet regulations, policies, and procedures. The Member will not use the Service for illegal software, illegal pornography, spamming, linkspamming, spamdexing, or any use of distribution lists to any person who has not given specific permission to be included in such a process. For purposes of this AUP, facilitation of the illegal distribution of copyrighted materials, through operation of a "hub", "tracker", or other filesharing mechanism, shall be considered identical to the actual illegal distribution of those copyrighted materials. The Member agrees not to transmit through the service any unlawful, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable material of any kind or nature. A cleanup fee of 100.00/hour (minimum 4 hours) may be assessed by ASUSTeK for violation of these terms. The Member further agrees not to transmit any material that encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law or regulation. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems are prohibited. The Member shall not interfere with another Member's use and enjoyment of the Service or another entity's use and enjoyment of similar services. ASUSTeK may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate the Service should the Member's conduct fail to conform to the terms and conditions of the AUP.</p>

<p>9. INDEMNIFICATION</p>

<p>The Member agrees to indemnify and hold ASUSTeK, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of the Member's use of the Service, the violation of this AUP by the Member, or the infringement by the Member, or other user of the Service using the Member's computer, of any intellectual property or any other right of any person or entity.</p>

<p>10. TERMINATION</p>

<p>Either the Member or ASUSTeK may terminate the Service with or without cause at any time and may do so immediately. ASUSTeK shall not be liable to the Member or any third party for termination of the Service. Should the Member not use the Service for a period of three months, ASUSTeK may terminate the Service immediately. Should the Member object to any terms or conditions of the AUP or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with the Service in any way, the Member's only recourse is to immediately: (1) discontinue use of the Service; (2) terminate the Member's membership; and (3) notify ASUSTeK of the Member's termination. Upon termination of the Service, the Member's right to use the Service immediately ceases.</p>
