%description
p910nd implements the port 9100 network printer protocol which simply
copies any incoming data on the port to the printer (and in the reverse
direction, if bidirectional mode is selected). Both parallel and USB
printers are supported. This protocol was used in HP's printers and is
called JetDirect (probably TM). p910nd is particularly useful for
diskless hosts and embedded devices because it does not require any disk
space for spooling as this is done at the sending host.
