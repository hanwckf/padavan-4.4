# LIC: GPL

This is a user-space implementation of L2TP (RFC 2661) for Linux.

Copying
-------

All software included in this package is Copyright 2002 Roaring
Penguin Software Inc.  You may distribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (the "GPL"), Version 2, or (at your option)
any later version.

Handlers
--------

Part of the l2tp code is implemented in the l2tpd program, and part of
it is implemented as "handlers".  A handler is a shared-object library
which is dynamically linked into l2tpd at run-time using the
"load-handler" configuration directive.

Although the handlers included with this package (sync-pppd and cmd)
are licensed under the GPL, as a special exception, you may write your
own handlers which link to code in this package and not release them
under the GPL.  There may be other reasons why your handlers must
be released under the GPL (for example, they may link with other GPL'd
code), but in the absence of other reasons, you may keep your handlers
proprietary.

Installation
------------

./configure && make
make install

Now read l2tpd(8) and l2tp.conf(5)
