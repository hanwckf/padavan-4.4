.TH blkmapd 8 "11 August 2011"
.SH NAME
blkmapd \- pNFS block layout mapping daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "blkmapd [-d] [-f]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B blkmapd
daemon performs device discovery and mapping for the parallel NFS (pNFS) block layout
client [RFC5663].
.PP
The pNFS block layout protocol builds a complex storage hierarchy from a set
of
.I simple volumes.
These simple volumes are addressed by content, using a signature on the
volume to uniquely name each one.
The daemon locates a volume by examining each block device in the system for
the given signature.
.PP
The topology typically consists of a hierarchy of volumes built by striping,
slicing, and concatenating the simple volumes.
The
.B blkmapd
daemon uses the device-mapper driver to construct logical devices that
reflect the server topology, and passes these devices to the kernel for use
by the pNFS block layout client.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
Performs device discovery only then exits.
.TP
.B -f
Runs
.B blkmapd
in the foreground and sends output to stderr (as opposed to syslogd)
