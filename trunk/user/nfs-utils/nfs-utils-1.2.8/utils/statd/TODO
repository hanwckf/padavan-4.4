Some things still left to do (not a comprehensive list):

* Go through Olaf's extensive changes (especially the list and callback
  handling, which is the meat of the server) and understand everything
  that he's done.

* Continue checking for security holes.

* Handle multiple SM_MON requests that are identical save for the "priv"
  information.  How should I do this?  No spec's...(it's not really
  supposed to happen).  [Did Olaf already address this?]

* BETTER CODE COMMENTS!
