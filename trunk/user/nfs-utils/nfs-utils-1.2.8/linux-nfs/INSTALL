Even though the Makefiles offer a `make install' instruction,
I would suggest against using it yet. I have run nfsd and the nfs
client without kernel oopses for a while, but the picture may change
if you start playing with lockd. Automatic installation may not even
work for the kernel makefiles yet.

I'd therefore advise that you use a separate Linux box for testing
if you have one. Use the etc/copy script to copy all modules and
support programs, and run the ins script to start the show. rmm
will clean up afterwards (provided you didn't trigger an oops).
