The nsm_client program is intended for testing statd. It has the ability
to act as a synthetic NSM client for sending artificial NSM calls to any
host you choose.

It also has an NLM simulator that implements the call that statd uses to
communicate with lockd. The daemon simulator will start itself up,
register as an NLM service and listen for "downcalls" from statd. When
it gets one, it will log a message.

Note that lockd will need to be down when using the daemon simulator. It
also does not implement the entire NLM protocol and is only really
useful for testing statd's downcall.
