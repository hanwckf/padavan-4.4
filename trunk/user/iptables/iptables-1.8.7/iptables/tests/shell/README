To run the test suite (as root):
 $ cd iptables/tests/shell
 # ./run-tests.sh

Test files are executable files with the pattern <<name_N>> , where N is the
expected return code of the executable. Since they are located with `find',
test-files can be spreaded in any sub-directories.

You can turn on a verbose execution by calling:
 # ./run-tests.sh -v

And to run test suite for pariticular test files:
 # ./run-tests.sh <PATH_OF_TESTFILES>

Also, test-files will receive the environment variable $XT_MULTI which contains
the path to the old iptables (xtables-legacy-multi) or new iptables (xtables-nft-multi)
binary being tested.
