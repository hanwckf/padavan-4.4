.B iptables-save
and
.B ip6tables-save
are used to dump the contents of IP or IPv6 Table in easily parseable format
either to STDOUT or to a specified file.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-modprobe\fR \fImodprobe_program\fP
Specify the path to the modprobe program. By default, iptables-save will
inspect /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe to determine the executable's path.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR \fIfilename\fP
Specify a filename to log the output to. If not specified, iptables-save
will log to STDOUT.
.TP

include the current values of all packet and byte counters in the output
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-table\fR \fItablename\fP
restrict output to only one table. If the kernel is configured with automatic
module loading, an attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for
that table if it is not already there.
