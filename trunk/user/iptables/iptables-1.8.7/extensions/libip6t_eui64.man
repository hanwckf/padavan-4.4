This module matches the EUI-64 part of a stateless autoconfigured IPv6 address.
It compares the EUI-64 derived from the source MAC address in Ethernet frame
with the lower 64 bits of the IPv6 source address. But "Universal/Local"
bit is not compared. This module doesn't match other link layer frame, and
is only valid in the
.BR PREROUTING ,
.BR INPUT
and
.BR FORWARD
chains.
