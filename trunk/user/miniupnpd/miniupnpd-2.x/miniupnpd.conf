# LAN network interfaces IPs / networks
# There can be multiple listening IPs for SSDP traffic, in that case
# use multiple 'listening_ip=...' lines, one for each network interface.
# It can be IP address or network interface name (ie. "eth0")
# It is mandatory to use the network interface name in order to enable IPv6
# HTTP is available on all interfaces.
# When MULTIPLE_EXTERNAL_IP is enabled, the external IP
# address associated with the subnet follows. For example:

# and end the rule set with "deny 0-65535 0.0.0.0/0 0-65535"
# The following default ruleset allows specific LAN side IP addresses
# to request only ephemeral ports. It is recommended that users
# modify the IP ranges to match their own internal networks, and
# also consider implementing network-specific restrictions
# CAUTION: failure to enforce any rules may permit insecure requests to be made!
