Multi-binary compilation
========================

To compile for systems without much space (floppy distributions etc), you
can create a single binary. This will save disk space by avoiding repeated
code between the various parts.
If you are familiar with "busybox", it's the same principle.

To compile the multi-binary, first "make clean" (if you've compiled
previously), then

make PROGRAMS="programs you want here" MULTI=1

To use the binary, symlink it from the desired executable:

ln -s dropbearmulti dropbear
ln -s dropbearmulti dbclient
etc

then execute as normal:

./dropbear <options here>
