.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mroute
objects are multicast routing cache entries created by a user level
mrouting daemon (f.e.
.B pimd
or
.B mrouted
).

Due to the limitations of the current interface to the multicast routing
engine, it is impossible to change
.B mroute
objects administratively, so we may only display them.  This limitation
will be removed in the future.

.SS ip mroute show - list mroute cache entries

.TP
.BI to " PREFIX " (default)

.TP
.BI iif " NAME"
the interface on which multicast packets are received.

.TP
.BI from " PREFIX"
the prefix selecting the IP source addresses of the multicast route.
