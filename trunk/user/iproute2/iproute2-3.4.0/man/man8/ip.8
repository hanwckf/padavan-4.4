.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR "\-V" , " -Version"
print the version of the
.B ip
utility and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-s" , " \-stats", " \-statistics"
output more information.  If the option
appears twice or more, the amount of information increases.
As a rule, the information is statistics or some time values.

.TP
.BR "\-l" , " \-loops"
Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip addr flush' logic
will attempt before giving up.  The default is 10.
Zero (0) means loop until all addresses are removed.

.TP
.BR "\-f" , " \-family"
followed by protocol family identifier:
.BR "inet" , " inet6"
or
.B link
,enforce the protocol family to use.  If the option is not present,
the protocol family is guessed from other arguments.  If the rest
of the command line does not give enough information to guess the
family,
.B ip
falls back to the default one, usually
.B inet
or
.BR "any" .
.B link
is a special family identifier meaning that no networking protocol
is involved.

.TP
.B \-4
shortcut for
.BR "-family inet" .

.TP
.B \-6
shortcut for
.BR "\-family inet6" .

.TP
.B \-0
shortcut for
.BR "\-family link" .

.TP
.BR "\-o" , " \-oneline"
output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds
with the
.B '\e\'
character. This is convenient when you want to count records
with
.BR wc (1)
 or to
.BR grep (1)
the output.

.TP
.BR "\-r" , " \-resolve"
use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of
host addresses.

.I OBJECT

.TP
.B address

.TP
.B l2tp
- tunnel ethernet over IP (L2TPv3).

.TP
.B link
- network device.

.TP
.B maddress
- multicast address.

.TP
.B monitor
- watch for netlink messages.

.TP
.B mroute
- multicast routing cache entry.

.TP
.B mrule
- rule in multicast routing policy database.

.TP
.B neighbour
- manage ARP or NDISC cache entries.

.TP
.B netns
- manage network namespaces.

.TP
.B ntable
- manage the neighbor cache's operation.

.TP
.B route
- routing table entry.

.TP
.B rule
- rule in routing policy database.

.TP
.B tunnel
- tunnel over IP.

.TP
.B tuntap
- manage TUN/TAP devices.

.TP
.B xfrm
- manage IPSec policies.

.PP
The names of all objects may be written in full or
abbreviated form, f.e.
.B address
is abbreviated as
.B addr
or just
.B a.

.SS
.I COMMAND

Specifies the action to perform on the object.
The set of possible actions depends on the object type.
As a rule, it is possible to
.BR "add" , " delete"
and
.B show
(or
.B list
) objects, but some objects do not allow all of these operations
or have some additional commands.  The
.B help
command is available for all objects.  It prints
out a list of available commands and argument syntax conventions.
.sp
If no command is given, some default command is assumed.
Usually it is
.B list
or, if the objects of this class cannot be listed,
.BR "help" .

.SH HISTORY
