Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd libusb-@LIBUSB_VERSION@.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # unpack the sources
  % cd libusb-@LIBUSB_VERSION@                           # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                             # run the `configure' script
  % make                                    # build libusb
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                            # install libusb

The Nitty-Gritty
================

The 'configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. For a complete list, type:

  ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                           [ Defaults to /usr/local ]

*  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                           [ Defaults to the value given to --prefix ]

Options can be given to the compiler and linker by setting
environment variables before running configure. A few of the more
important ones:

 CC       : The C compiler to use
 CPPFLAGS : Flags for the C preprocesser such as -I and -D
 CFLAGS   : C compiler flags

The most important use of this is to set the
optimization/debugging flags. For instance, to compile with no
debugging information at all, run configure as:

 CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure           # Bourne compatible shells (sh/bash/zsh)

or,

 setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure  # csh and variants


Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. There are also more
detailed flags to control individual directories. However, the
use of these flags is not tested.

A shell script libusb-config is created during the configure
process, and installed in the bin/ directory
($exec_prefix/bin). This is used to determine the location of libusb
when building applications.  If you move libusb after installation,
it will be necessary to edit this file.
