How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug, visit http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/ and fill
out a bug report form.

Please make sure to include:

* The version of libusb

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testlibusb program that is built 
  in the libusb/ directory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches can be sent to libusb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

If the patch fixes a bug, it is usually a good idea to include
all the information described in "How to Report Bugs".

Building
========

It should be as simple as running these two commands:

./configure
make

One common problem is building the SGML documentation. On some systems,
like SuSE, you will need to set the SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment
variable to something similar to this (actual paths may vary):

export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/share/sgml/CATALOG.docbook_3:/usr/share/sgml/CATALOG.docbook-dsssl-stylesheets:/usr/share/sgml/openjade/catalog"

On recent versions of Fedora Core (FC5 Test 2 atleast), this command may be
needed:

export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/catalog"

or possibly:

export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/docbook"

C++ Support
===========

There are reasonable unit tests available - run "make check" to do the
tests. Note that some of the tests will unexpectedly pass if you don't have
a specfic type of Logitech mouse connected, and some are expected to fail
unless you are running as root (or otherwise have permissions to access the
device).

Building the C++ documentation requires Doxygen
(http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
