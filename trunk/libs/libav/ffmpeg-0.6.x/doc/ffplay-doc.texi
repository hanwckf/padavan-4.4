@section Advanced options
@table @option
@item -pix_fmt @var{format}
Set pixel format.
@item -stats
Show the stream duration, the codec parameters, the current position in
the stream and the audio/video synchronisation drift.
@item -debug
Print specific debug info.
@item -bug

@item -vismv
Visualize motion vectors.
@item -fast
Non-spec-compliant optimizations.
@item -genpts

@item -rtp_tcp
Force RTP/TCP protocol usage instead of RTP/UDP. It is only meaningful
if you are streaming with the RTSP protocol.
@item -sync @var{type}
Set the master clock to audio (@code{type=audio}), video
(@code{type=video}) or external (@code{type=ext}). Default is audio. The
master clock is used to control audio-video synchronization. Most media
players use audio as master clock, but in some cases (streaming or high
quality broadcast) it is necessary to change that. This option is mainly
used for debugging purposes.
@item -threads @var{count}
Set the thread count.
@item -ast @var{audio_stream_number}
Select the desired audio stream number, counting from 0. The number
refers to the list of all the input audio streams. If it is greater
than the number of audio streams minus one, then the last one is
selected, if it is negative the audio playback is disabled.
@item -vst @var{video_stream_number}
Select the desired video stream number, counting from 0. The number
refers to the list of all the input video streams. If it is greater
than the number of video streams minus one, then the last one is
selected, if it is negative the video playback is disabled.
@item -sst @var{subtitle_stream_number}
Select the desired subtitle stream number, counting from 0. The number
refers to the list of all the input subtitle streams. If it is greater
than the number of subtitle streams minus one, then the last one is
