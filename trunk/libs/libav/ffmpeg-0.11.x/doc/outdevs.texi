@chapter Output Devices
@c man begin OUTPUT DEVICES

Output devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to write
multimedia data to an output device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported output devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-outdevs".

You can disable all the output devices using the configure option
"--disable-outdevs", and selectively enable an output device using the
option "--enable-outdev=@var{OUTDEV}", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-outdev=@var{OUTDEV}".

The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled output devices (amongst the muxers).

A description of the currently available output devices follows.

@section alsa

ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) output device.

@section oss

OSS (Open Sound System) output device.

@section sdl

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) output device.

This output devices allows to show a video stream in an SDL
window. Only one SDL window is allowed per application, so you can
have only one instance of this output device in an application.

To enable this output device you need libsdl installed on your system
when configuring your build.

For more information about SDL, check:
@url{http://www.libsdl.org/}

@subsection Options

@table @option

@item window_title
Set the SDL window title, if not specified default to the filename

@item icon_title

to the same value of @var{window_title}.

@item window_size
Set the SDL window size, can be a string of the form
@var{width}x@var{height} or a video size abbreviation.
If not specified it defaults to the size of the input video.
@end table

@subsection Examples

The following command shows the @command{ffmpeg} output is an
SDL window, forcing its size to the qcif format:
@example
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -window_size qcif -f sdl "SDL output"
@end example
